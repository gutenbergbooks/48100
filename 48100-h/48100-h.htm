<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> years ago the author prepared a little Manual
entitled "The Sunday-School Worker Assisted," etc., which
was so favorably received as to call for a large edition without
any special advertising. What has seemed to be a most
imperative call has again come up, from various sections of
our land, and from many denominations of Christians, for a
fuller and more complete work, illustrated with examples.
If our pastors, superintendents or teachers, wished for specific
details of all the departments of the Sabbath-school,
they complained that they were compelled to purchase a
dozen English and a dozen American works, and even
then there were important topics of information still unreached.
Besides, books written a quarter of a century ago
will not fully meet the requirements of an intelligent Sabbath-school
man at this day. The cause is making constant
progress, and many real improvements have been
made during the past few years which are worthy of special
record and notice.</p>

<p>Never before has the Holy Bible been so exalted, so taught,
so applied, and made so interesting as now. Never before
were our best Sabbath-schools devoted to such pure, simple,
child-like worship of God as now; and never before was the
high and holy aim of <i>immediate conversion</i> of the scholars
to Christ, and then their thorough religious training, kept
steadily in view, as it is in many Sunday-schools at the
present time.</p>

<p>The Sabbath-school, as the true working-field of the
Christian churches ("The Bible School," as Dr. Chalmers
called it), is now the grand rallying cry of the faithful.</p>

<p>The aim and design of this work is to observe, collate,
and condense, as far as possible, the <i>best</i> thoughts, experience,
and observation of Sabbath-school laborers and
authors, not only in this country but also in Great Britain,
and to combine these with the observation and experience
of the writer during the last forty-five years. The author
is greatly indebted particularly to the London Sunday-School
Union publications, and to <i>The Sunday-School
Times</i> of Philadelphia, as well as to most of his fellow-laborers
and writers in both countries. Gladly would he
give credit in every instance, but their works have been so
read and their thoughts gathered up, preserved, and noted
for use during many years, and their views so assimilated
with the author's and made his own, that he is now quite
unable to trace them accurately to their right sources. They
have become the property of all, and he has appropriated
and adopted them into the line of his own thought in the
one great work.</p>

<p>The best examples and the best new improvements are
here given for the Sabbath-school artist to copy. No one
man or school or country embodies them all. None, however,
are mere theories. Everything here stated has been
tried and proved.</p>

<p>The future progress of the Sabbath-school will be carefully
watched, in order to add to or modify subsequent editions
of this book, so that the Sabbath-school worker, with
no other guide-board but this "Index," may be enabled,
by divine grace, to enter the right path and to do a good
Christian work in training up the children and youth of
his generation.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is a place where the churches of Christ
meet with the children and youth for the
worship and service of God. It is the
Church of God caring for the children on the Sabbath
day. Every song of praise, as well as every
prayer and reading and study of the Word of God,
together with every exhortation, address or sermon,
should rise to a high and holy act of simple, life-like,
child-like devotion. The place should be comfortable,
attractive, light, airy and cheerful. It should
be dry and well warmed. The walls may be covered
with prints, hymns, and Scripture mottoes; or, as
some of our wealthy congregations have done, they
may be frescoed beautifully with illuminated texts or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
paintings representing Scripture scenes, to attract the
children to the house of God&mdash;to their <i>Sabbath
Home</i>. Especial care should be taken that the seats
provided are adapted in size, height, and form, to
all ages and sizes, from the wee ones in the infant
classes up to the larger scholars and the members
of the adult classes. The three-sides-of-an-octagon
form of seat is found to answer well, and is much
cheaper than the circular seats. Infant classes will
need a room by themselves, and sometimes raised seats
are to be preferred. A good blackboard and crayons,
with good maps, should be furnished to every room,
together with a well-selected library, both for teachers
and scholars. Keep on file a few good Sunday-school
papers and magazines. It would be well also to
have a few reference Bibles and a Bible Dictionary.
But the glory of the Sabbath-school is the open Bible,
the living Teacher, the Church Militant and aggressive.
Said De Witt Clinton: "The Sunday-school
is one of the three great powers by which the moral
world is to be moved." Says the Rev. Dr. Daggett:
"The Sabbath-school is to do vastly more than all
other agencies of the Church." Said John Angell
James: "In a few years we shall look upon all the
past progress of the Sunday-school but as the beginning,
as a kind of first-fruits, an earnest of the future
of this great institution of the Christian Church."
Said the Rev. Dr. Campbell, of the <i>British Banner</i>,
London: "With respect to countless multitudes, it is
mainly the work of the Sunday-school teacher to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
carry out the command of our Lord to preach the
gospel to every creature. The Sunday-school, for the
<i>individual</i>, for the <i>family</i>, for the <i>Church</i>, for the
<i>nation</i>, and for the <i>world</i>, is one of the principal
mottoes to be inscribed on the banners of the faithful;
and many well-meant but feeble agencies on
which much religious activity is now <i>frittered</i> away,
will, we believe, at length be merged in this grand
institution. The conviction is strong in our mind
that the Sunday-school Union, as a great central
source of light, life, and power, is on the threshhold
of a glorious career of usefulness, and will speedily
become, in the hands of the great Master, an agency
for good to an extent beyond all present appreciation
by the Christian Church."</p>

HISTORY AND PROGRESS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE history of Sabbath-schools is nearly allied
to the onward progress of the Church
of God in the earth. In all ages, whenever
pure religion has been revived, it would seem that
especial attention has always been given to the early
religious instruction and training of children and
youth by the Church of God; and herein lies the
grand <span class="smcap">Sunday-school idea</span>. Says a Scotch divine:
"Vital religion, and the godly upbringing of the
young, have ever gone hand in hand." The soul is
diseased, and a Bible education is the only remedy.
In that wonderful <span class="smcap">Book</span>, which extends its record
over the long period of four thousand years of this
world's history, there is throughout a wonderful regard
for children. Of the patriarch Abraham, nearly
four thousand years ago, it is written: "For I know
him, that he will command his children and his
household after him, and they shall keep the way
of the Lord." Gen. xviii.&nbsp;19. With what wonderful
power does the history of the childhood of Joseph,
and Moses, and David, and Samuel, and Daniel, illustrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the value of the instruction and religious training
of children.</p>

<p>When Moses, the great lawgiver of Israel, received
the law amid the thunderings and lightnings and
earthquakes of Mount Sinai, he called "<span class="smcap">All</span> Israel"
together (Deut. v.&nbsp;1), and by divine direction his
words were (Deut. vi.&nbsp;6): "Hear, O <i>Israel</i>....
These words, which I command thee this day, shall
be (1) in thine heart: and (2) thou shalt <i>teach</i> them
diligently unto thy children," etc., <i>i. e.</i>, the <i>Church's</i>
children&mdash;not parents exclusive, but inclusive of
course. "Israel," that was called upon by Moses,
was the Church of God upon earth, and it is her express
duty to the end of time to see that all her
children shall be "taught of the Lord." It is true that
parents are the divinely-appointed guardians and instructors
of their children, and this obligation rests
upon them; and yet they are, alas! too often incapable
of the religious instruction of their own children
or of any other, besides being often indifferent; and
the Church of God, by her catechetical or Sabbath-school
instruction, has always had, and probably will
always have, to supply the lack of unfaithful parents.
There is no agency which so supplies the lack of
<i>mothers</i> as a good Sabbath-school.</p>

<p>Thus we find in Deuteronomy, nearly four thousand
years ago, the great Sabbath-school principle
foreshadowed and embodied; and where, we may
ask, can be found in all the Bible a more definite
authorization or <i>divine appointment</i> for any of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
great denominational Christian Churches which now
so bless our land than is here found for the Sabbath-school?
It is ordained and blessed of God. The
Sabbath-school is simply the Church of Christ
putting forth its legitimate effort in its most inviting
field of action. It is <i>the</i> regular systematic working
department of the Christian Church&mdash;not an outside
auxiliary, but an inside,&mdash;the Church itself in action;
and as such let it be carefully guarded and cherished.
The same Divine lips which said "Go preach," said
also and equally to his disciples, "Go <i>teach</i>." Says
the Rev. J. H. Vincent: "There is just as much divine
authority for the Sabbath-school as there is for the
sanctuary&mdash;no more." Our Divine Lord and Master
himself repeatedly astonished his own disciples by
his particular notice of and care for little children,
and with sore displeasure he rebuked his followers
for hindering them from being brought to him.</p>

<p>It was not until nearly the close of the second century,
or, according to Tertullian, in the year A.D.&nbsp;180,
that the Christian Church felt compelled, in
order to check the defection of heathen converts, to
set about the establishment of those celebrated catechumenical
schools, of which Origen was one of the
catechists, for the systematic religious instruction by
the Church of Christ of the children and youth.</p>

<p>So useful and necessary, however, did this work
prove itself to be, that very soon similar schools were
universally established. They continued to flourish
until near the close of the sixth century, when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
declined and became obscured for ten long centuries
in the gloom of the Dark Ages, with only an occasional
prince, or pastor, or layman in the spirit of
the Master, to teach the children the way of life.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, however, on the dawn
of the Reformation, Martin Luther established his
celebrated Sunday-schools at Wittemberg in the year
1527; and soon after John Knox inaugurated the
Sunday-schools of Scotland, "with readers," as the
history of Scotland informs us, in 1560; so that on
the incoming of the Reformation the children were
again "taught of the Lord." In the year 1580, Borromeo,
the pious Archbishop of Milan, established a
system of Sunday-schools throughout his large diocese
in Lombardy.</p>

<p>In our own land our Pilgrim Fathers early entered
upon the work; for Ellis, in his History of Roxbury,
Massachusetts, says: "In 1674, 6th 11th month, is
the first record of a Sabbath-school." The records
of the Pilgrim Church in Plymouth, Massachusetts,
inform us that a Sabbath-school was there organized
as early as in 1680. Joseph Alleine, the author of
the "Alarm to the Unconverted," opened a Sabbath-school
in England in 1688, and many others might
be mentioned in both countries in succession. But
the first Sabbath-school of which we have any <i>authentic,
definite, and detailed</i> account, extending over a
period of a quarter of a century, was that established
by Ludwig Hacker in Ephratah, Lancaster county,
Pennsylvania, as early as the year 1747. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
continued uninterruptedly during a period of more
than thirty years, until the building was taken for a
soldiers' hospital in the time of the Revolutionary
War. It enjoyed precious seasons of revival, and had
its children's meetings, and we are informed that
many children were hopefully converted to God. We
have before us a long letter from Dr. Fahnestock to
the Rev. W. T. Brantley, D.D., of Philadelphia, written
in 1835, detailing many interesting facts connected
with the history of this Sabbath-school, drawn
from living pupils and records.</p>

<p>Robert Raikes instituted not only, but <i>organized</i>,
the <small>SYSTEM</small> of Sabbath-schools, and popularized them
in England, in Gloucester, in February, 1781. All
benevolence was single-handed until such men as
Robert Raikes and William Wilberforce <i>organized</i>
it, and sent it forth systematized on its errand of love,
mercy and salvation throughout the world. Before
this, as we have seen, there were isolated occasional
Sabbath-schools, but their influence was confined
mainly to one city, one town, or one church, and
expired with an individual. But Robert Raikes
"founded Sabbath-schools for the Church universal."
John Wesley preached and <i>organized</i>. George
Whitefield preached, and did not organize. Robert
Raikes <i>organized</i> Sabbath-schools, but his predecessors
did not do so. And we can in both cases see the
important difference. Within the short space of four
years from the period when Mr. Raikes established
his first Sabbath-school in Gloucester, England, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
than one-quarter of a million of children in England
were enjoying the blessing of Sabbath-school instruction.
All honor, then, to Robert Raikes!</p>

<p>To Bishop Ashbury appears to belong the honor
of first introducing Robert Raikes's idea of Sabbath-schools
into this country, in Virginia in 1786. How
long the school was continued, or what was its influence
in Virginia, we are unable to state.</p>

<p>The first "Sunday-school <i>Society</i>" was formed
in London, September 7, 1785. This was on the
system of paid teachers, but when the plan of voluntary,
unpaid teachers had become established, this
society gave place to the present "London Sunday-School
Union," which was organized to meet this
change on the 13th of July, 1803. Both of these
societies were formed on the union plan, including
the various denominations, the first including an
equal number of Churchmen and Dissenters in its
management.</p>

<p>The First-day or Sunday-School Society in Philadelphia
was organized in 1791, and Bishop White was
its first president.</p>

<p>We learn from a carefully prepared editorial in
the first volume of the "Sunday-School Teacher's
Magazine and Journal of Education," published in
New York, 1823, that after a careful personal interview
of the editor with the parties, he had been enabled
to ascertain the precise time and the circumstances
under which the first Sabbath-school was
commenced in New York city. Mr. and Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Divie Bethune had spent part of the years 1801 and
1802 in England, where they had observed the progress
of Sunday-schools in Great Britain; and on
their return, in connection with their pious mother,
the late Mrs. Isabella Graham, they arranged their
plans, and "in the autumn of 1803 these three Christian
philanthropists opened the first Sunday-school
in New York for religious and catechcetical purposes,
at their own expense, at the house of Mrs. Leech, in
Mott street." Mrs. Graham and Mr. and Mrs. Bethune
then established two other Sabbath-schools in
other parts of the city, and soon after one for the
children in the alms-house in New York. It is to
the same source, too, that <i>adult</i> schools owe their
commencement in this country, or at least in New
York. Mrs. Graham, it is stated, opened the first
adult school in Greenwich, in 1814, on the second
Sabbath in June, only about two months before her
death. We are thus particular to state these facts,
for we are aware that a later date has been insisted
upon for the inauguration of the first Sunday-school
of New York.</p>

<p>Samuel Slater opened a school for his operatives
in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, in 1797. The Broadway
Baptist Sabbath-school, in Baltimore, was established
in 1804, and it is said to be still in operation.
Mrs. Amos Tappan (Miss Buckminster)
opened a Sabbath-school in Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
in 1803. We do not learn that the Churches
and organized Christian bodies took hold of the Sabbath-school
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
movement in this country, so as to <i>produce</i>
permanent and efficient <i>action</i>, until 1809, when
we find an elaborate constitution and plan of action
from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1810 a Sabbath-school
was organized in Beverly, Massachusetts, and
in Boston in 1812. Soon after this there began to
be a more general and awakened interest in the
Churches in behalf of Sabbath-schools, and the years
1814, 1815, and 1816 were years of most triumphant
progress, so that in 1817 Sunday-schools were organized
in most of our flourishing churches and
Christian communities throughout this country.</p>

<p>Early in 1816 the New York Sunday-School Union
was established, and is the first and oldest Union in
our land, having just celebrated its semi-centennial.
The American Sunday-School Union was organized
in 1824, to provide a juvenile Christian literature
(and from whence our public school district libraries
borrowed their first idea) and to plant a Sunday-school
wherever there is a population.</p>

<p>Surely, if any work in our land needs to be hastened,
it is that of the religious instruction of the
neglected children and youth of this nation by means
of Sabbath-schools. Not to mention the various
modern denominational movements, the above we
believe to be a correct history of the Sunday-school
progress, and we suppose it to be sufficiently full for
practical purposes in this work. We have ample
materials on this subject to fill a large volume, but
this may here suffice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
There are other questions, however, which ought
to be here recorded in connection with the progress
of the cause. In Great Britain the work is embarrassed
from the fact that as a general rule only the
children of the poor and middle classes attend their
Sabbath-schools. In the early stages of the Sabbath-school
movement in this country the same custom
prevailed here, and it is certainly worthy of record
by what means the change was effected.</p>

<p>Several years ago, while in attendance upon a
Sunday-school meeting, the writer of this enjoyed a
lengthened interview with the late Rev. Dr. Lyman
Beecher, then in his prime. Our conversation turned
upon that unfortunate feature of the cause in England
which virtually excluded all the better-to-do
children of that country. Dr. Beecher's eye lit up
at once, and with great animation, as he said to me:
"It was the same here at first, and I do not know
but I had an important hand in producing the change.
I saw the tendency of things, and feared that our
Sunday-schools would result in a failure if only the
poor children gained the benefit of them in this land,
and it troubled me for some year or two. At last,"
said he, energetically, "I resolved to overthrow that
system, and went and called upon Judge W., one
of my most influential families, and said, 'Judge
W&mdash;&mdash;, I want you to bring your children to Sunday-school
next Sabbath.' '<i>Me</i>!' exclaimed the
Judge in amazement. 'Yes, you,' calmly responded
Dr. Beecher: 'I have made up my mind to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
take <i>my children</i>, and I want you and a few others
of the best families to popularize the thing.' A little
explanation secured the object. He then called upon
Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;, the most aristocratic lady in the community,
and said, 'Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; I want you to lead
<i>your two daughters</i> into our Sunday-school next
Sabbath;' and, said the Doctor, 'Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; almost
shouted in astonishment;' but a more particular and
careful explanation than sufficed with Judge W&mdash;&mdash;
succeeded here; and then the family of the first physician
was in like manner secured, and we all turned
our labor and influence on the Sunday-school movement,
and it gave an unheard-of impetus to our Sunday-school,
and by means of the press and by letters
and personal conversation the facts became known
and met with almost universal approval and adoption
in our country, and the reform soon became
complete." Blessings, a thousand blessings rest upon
the memory of the man, or the men and women, who
aided to bring about this glorious change in this
land!</p>

<p>The law of progress is very noticeable in the teaching
of the Sabbath-school. Robert Raikes's first idea
was scarcely more than to keep the children out of
the streets and to protect the Sabbath. Then the
children were taught to read and write. After that
a great advance was made by the introduction of
the Bible as the reading-book; the next step was to
commit the Bible to memory; and then the Christian
Churches took hold of the Sabbath-school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
For awhile <i>Memory</i> was crowded to its utmost extent,
to the injury of the scholar, and more memorizing
became the hobby in most of our schools. After
a while the physicians checked this, by telling
us that by crowding the memory we were developing
a new disease amongst children, viz., Hydrocephalus,
or water on the brain. Then our schools
were in trouble, and resort was had to question-cards,
and finally question-books became the hobby. In a
few years question-books began to be stale and monotonous,
and we appealed to the imagination and
resorted to stories and anecdotes until they wearied,
and then we searched commentaries, and theology
was administered to the children in large doses. After
that what was called spiritual teaching was adopted,
but that soon degenerated into mere exhortation.
Now we find that we must comprehensively grasp
and rightly use them all, and make a hobby of none.
The <i>memory</i> is the grand store-house of the mind,
and it should be well filled; but it is folly to over-stock
it and overwhelm the brain. The <i>imagination</i>
is God's grand medium of worship and communion
with him and the spiritual world. We cannot worship
God without it. Let us not exorcise it because
some abuse it. "The <i>imagination</i> has the same
place in the faculties that the eye has among the
senses." The <i>intellect</i> is God's great gift which
distinguishes man from the brute. Let us never
worship nor pervert it. The <i>heart</i> is the soul of
man. To save it the Son of man came down from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
heaven to earth. Unless the heart is gained all is lost;
but if we appeal to the heart alone, we but develop
the puny Christian. Let us, therefore, use all wisely,
but misuse none. At first the aim of Sabbath-school
teaching was very feeble and indefinite: to keep the
children out of mischief&mdash;teach them to read the Bible&mdash;correct
their manners and make them good children&mdash;not
profane and disobedient. Then the aim was to
give them a general knowledge of Bible history and
catechism. The ablest early Sabbath-school works
published under the patronage of the Queen of England
did not even hint at the possible conversion of
the children. The Bible was long introduced as a
book of task lessons to the young, and catechism and
hymn learning engrossed our Bible classes. Now,
the Bible is exalted, and so applied in our Sabbath-schools
as to be the most attractive of all books to
the children and youth. <i>Now</i>, the aim of Sabbath-school
teaching is, or ought to be, the <i>immediate</i> conversion
of the children to Christ. It is a poor excuse
to suffer a child to drown because we have but one
opportunity of saving it. <i>Now</i>, many Sabbath-school
teachers have learned the great and precious
art of leading even little children to Jesus&mdash;"Just
now."</p>

<p>Sabbath-schools are, as we believe, about to enter
upon a great and glorious career, compared with
which all the past history of the cause is but as the
early dawn before a bright and glorious day; and this
era is the culture and training by the word and grace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of God of all that constitutes the best style of man
and Christian; for we hold it to be the true teacher's
position that there is no weakness or infirmity of temper,
habit, purpose, or character in any of our pupils
that the Sabbath-school, with its divine text-book and
the promised Spirit of God, is not perfectly competent
to remove. Let this be our standard, and according
to our faith be it unto us. May the great Master so
bless and prosper this heaven-born institution that
speedily "our children may <i>all</i> be taught of the
Lord, and that great may be the peace of our
children."</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE object of these gatherings is to arouse,
to instruct, and to train. 1. To explore the
districts, report the destitutions, and devise
the best ways of filling up existing schools, of planting
new schools, and reaching, if possible, every
neglected child. 2. To call attention to the bad or
inefficient habits in the modes of conducting and
teaching in our Sabbath-schools, and to suggest a
remedy by detailing the more excellent ways. 3. To
instruct and train teachers how they may prepare
and teach the lesson better, and how they can become
better acquainted with children's character,
language, and feelings. It is of prime importance
that there should be frequent and earnest conferences
of pastors, superintendents, and teachers, in order to
become acquainted with all the best modes and real
improvements that the most favored enjoy. A quarter
of a century or more ago, county Sunday-school
conventions and anniversaries were frequently held,
but they were usually crowded into a single afternoon,
giving the Bible Society the morning and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Temperance Union the evening of the day. The
time was insufficient to examine the state of the
cause, or the schools, with much care, although the
meetings were uniformly pleasant, and sometimes of
considerable interest; yet their influence was quite
limited and evanescent.</p>

<p>It was during the early autumn of 1856 that the
good Spirit prompted the Sabbath-school teachers
of Massachusetts, one thousand strong, to pay a visit
to the Crystal Palace and the Sabbath-school teachers
of New York. They were received with great cordiality,
and mingled delightfully with the Sabbath-school
teachers of New York and Brooklyn during
two or three days, closing with a grand Farewell
Meeting in Plymouth Church, Brooklyn. This religious
festival afforded a good opportunity for the
Sabbath-school laborers from the various sections of
the country to compare views and converse freely
about all departments of the good work. All this
proved to be interesting and profitable beyond all
expectation, and the result was, there arose a very
general desire to renew these prolonged conferences
of teachers, under other forms, as soon as practicable.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Massachusetts called a three-days
State Sabbath-school Convention, in the city of Boston,
later in the fall of the same year; and New
York held its first State Sabbath-school Convention,
of three days, in the city of Albany, in the month of
January, 1857. Both conventions were enthusiastic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and useful, and those States have continued these
meetings annually since that period; and most of
the Northern States, and some of the Southern
States, have followed the good example, with the
most beneficial results. They have awakened much
interest and aroused the people everywhere. Beside
the State meetings, County and Town Sunday-school
Conventions have been organized quite extensively,
combining counsels and efforts in all directions.
The States appointed County Secretaries or
Vice-Presidents, and counties gave the same office
to the towns, forming a medium of union and communication,
exploration and effort throughout.</p>

<p>These conventions are very useful; but care must
be taken or they will degenerate into dull, heavy
routine, or wordy discussions, or tedious essays, or
mere story-telling, or a waste of time in organizing.</p>

<p>The whole value of Sunday-school conventions
depends, of course, upon the manner in which they
are conducted. Like the teaching by a wrong mode,
they can be made profoundly wearisome, when they
should always be made profoundly interesting and
profitable. Let the convention be called with <small>GREAT
CARE</small> and <small>EFFORT</small>. Let the call always proceed
from the right source. Consider well as to the right
time and the right place. Then first carefully counsel
with the leading pastors and superintendents of
the various denominations, so that they may understand
it and arrange for it. Get a pastor to speak
particularly and personally beforehand to three or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
four of his most active, influential ladies, asking
them to notify other families and arrange so as to
favor the convention. Take the same course with the
men; for we must have much personal effort in getting
it up. Let the call state distinctly the object,
and, as far as may be, the order of the meetings,
and send it out as early as three or four weeks before
the meeting, to all, and with particular care. Do not
depend upon newspaper advertisements to give notice.
Get as many pastors, superintendents, and
teachers as possible to <i>pledge</i> a constant attendance
at every meeting and be ready to aid at all times.
Secure a light, cheerful, comfortable room. Place a
large, clean blackboard, with crayons and rubber,
on the platform, together with a supply of paper and
pencils for taking notes. Appoint a good leader of
singing. Meet promptly, and commence the meeting
punctually, although but few may be present. Let
the first half-hour be one of warm, earnest devotion.
Have some appropriate, burning words of Scripture&mdash;two
or three verses&mdash;ready to kindle and glow in
every heart. The prayers and hymns should all be
brief and directly to the point of seeking the blessing
of God, without which all the efforts will be
vain. Without God we can do nothing. Next call
to order naturally, and waste not a moment of
time in a simple organization. Have an understanding
beforehand and call a good, influential man,
fitted to preside, to the chair, and appoint a suitable
Secretary, and, perhaps, a Business Committee.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Then enter earnestly into the work before you.
Wait not a moment for the business committee to
report, but let the chairman call for reports from
some section as to the state and prospects of Sabbath-schools.
Gather information, and let that information
be the <i>basis</i> of systematic action.</p>

<p>The missionary and aggressive feature should first
claim attention. Care must be taken that unimportant
routine of particular schools does not clog the
convention. If in a State gathering, you can hardly
have time to hear reports except from counties. If
a county meeting, hear from towns; and if in a
town gathering, you can descend and hear suggestive
reports from schools, leading to right action. In
other conventions, references to individual schools
must be mostly in the way of some spirited illustration.
Get a bird's-eye view of your whole field, and
then detail the best plans of meeting deficiencies, so
as to reach effectually the whole outlying population,
either by voluntary effort, or by Sabbath-school missionaries,
in filling up existing schools and planting
others as needed. After a thorough canvass of your
whole field, then inquire what are the great wants
and difficulties in our present Sabbath-school operations?
and how can we best remove them and introduce
all the <i>real</i> modern improvements?</p>

<p>Descend next to details as to organization, good
records, the library, superintendents, teachers, and
how to get them and train them so as to be efficient;
good order, music, prayers, and good teaching in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Infant, Scripture, and Bible classes, with such helps
as the blackboard, object-lessons, map-drawing,
Bible geography, and history; teachers' meetings,
and how successfully and profitably to conduct them;
missionary meetings, monthly concerts of prayer,
temperance meetings, social gatherings, mothers'
meetings in mission schools, and especially children's
prayer-meetings; addresses, reviews, catechisms,
&amp;c., may all be considered.</p>

<p>Then again we want help for the teacher; how to
teach, with examples of various modes; illustrative
teaching, pictorial teaching; on the art of securing
attention, and on the art of questioning; visiting,
conversions, and training for Christian work and
usefulness; how to enlist the Church, the parents,
and the community, the pastors and church officers,
in this great work. These and other subjects should
be brought up, not for indefinite discussion and debate,
but for careful information, deliberate thought,
and suggestions resulting from observation and mature
experience.</p>

<p>Let all things be so arranged that one topic will
naturally flow into and call up another; and what
you touch, handle well. If one subject is brought
up, and no one is ready to take it up, pass on to another,
until you come to one upon which some person
has a question to raise, or a suggestion or information
to offer, or an experience to refer to about it.
Waste not a moment of time in pointless and prosy
harangues. A good time merely, pleasant anecdotes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
or touching recitals of dying children, or sharp discussions,
are not sufficient to constitute a good Sabbath-school
convention. The great idea of Sabbath-schools,
be it never forgotten, is not singing, or exhibitions,
or addresses, or concerts. It is to meet
together for the saving worship of God, in the
thoughtful study of his Holy Word, in the singing
of his praise, and in solemn, believing prayer,
through our Lord Jesus Christ. These are the high
and holy objects to which all our conventions should
contribute.</p>

<p>An important National Sabbath-school Convention
was held in Philadelphia in the year 1859, and
this gave an additional impulse to the cause. It was,
however, during the years 1863 and 1864, that it was
observed that these interesting Sabbath-school conventions
were in danger of losing their power. They
had fallen into a sort of routine, and had begun to be
monotonous and stale to the regular attendants, because
they were not sufficiently practical and profitable.
The questions were, therefore, forced upon
us, What must be done? What does the present
crisis of the cause demand? How can our great
gatherings be made more <i>useful</i>? Deliberation and
counsel brought the answer: "We need more <i>instruction</i>."
Teachers need training. They need to
be taught how to prepare the lesson; how to secure
attention; how to teach infants, juveniles, and adults;
how to apply Bible truths. Superintendents need instruction
how to gain order; how to organize and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
classify; how to open, conduct, and address and review
the school; how to train the teachers and enlist
the interest and service of parents, pastors, and
the churches. All need inspiring with the spirit
that will go forth and plant new schools, and
gather in and secure a good religious education to
every child in the community. In the way of accomplishment
of these grand results the obstacles
were foreseen&mdash;such as prosy essays, tedious discussions,
formal addresses or sermons, which generalized
everything and rendered it nought. On the
other hand, we found a surfeit of touching little stories
and old anecdotes, and it became necessary to
strike out boldly for a reformation and an entire
change of base in our plan of operations. Accordingly
resort was had to what are called Sunday-school
Institutes.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THEY have grown out of the idea of the Public-school
Teachers' Institutes, which have
been sustained for many years with interest
and profit, the expenses being cheerfully met out of
the State Treasury. Our Sabbath-school Institutes
are modeled somewhat on the same plan. The object
is, by means of practical essays, model lessons,
lectures, and drill exercises, to train the teachers and
officers for their work. Institutes differ from other
conventions in calling out the audience in responses,
recapitulations, and more detailed instruction. They
will take their character very much from the character
and course pursued by the conductor. No two
persons, perhaps, would conduct them alike. For
instance, one man would give more attention to superintending,
addresses, public exercises, singing, etc.
Another to the blackboard, object teaching, and
sacred geography; while another still, would give
more attention to methods of teaching, teachers'
meetings, normal classes, model lessons, etc. We
would prefer to combine <small>ALL</small> these things in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
due proportion, in every Institute, and make as complete
and clear work on every point as possible. The
great object is to make them <i>useful</i>. If this is
secured, they will be all the more interesting. There
are two great subjects which should always be before
every Institute, as well as every convention, viz.,
1. The extension of Sabbath-schools, so as to reach
all of the neglected; 2. The elevation and improvement
of existing schools; and they need improving,
if not reforming, in every part.</p>

<p>The first idea of a Sabbath-school Institute that
ever entered the mind of the writer was suggested
to him by a pastor, Rev. W. A. Niles, in the State
Sunday-school Convention at Buffalo, New York,
in 1864. An experiment was soon successfully made,
and since then they have become almost universally
popular and useful. The same thought, we have
since been informed, had been considered, and Institutes
held by the Rev. J. H. Vincent, in the Western
Methodist Conferences; and as long ago as 1827, the
New York Sunday-school Union, in its Eleventh
Annual Report, particularly recommended this plan
"of a school for the training of Sabbath-school
teachers."</p>

<p>The forms of these Institutes are various. Many
are made up partly of convention and partly of Institute
exercises. Ordinarily two or three days and
evenings are entirely devoted to one, by a county, or
district comprising a dozen counties. Another plan,
when held in a city, is to devote all the evenings and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a part of the afternoons of a week to it; as in New
York city last year, and recently in Brooklyn; also,
prefacing it with an elaborate sermon on the Sabbath
evening previous. Another plan still is to devote the
usual weekly Teachers' Meeting of a school to a
regular normal class or training Institute. All these
plans are useful in the hands of a good conductor.</p>

<h3><i>The Subjects</i></h3>

<p class="nodent">for consideration in an Institute may be suggested as

</ol>
</div>

<h3><i>The Exercises</i></h3>

<p class="nodent">of an Institute may be&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Devotional exercises for specific objects.</p>

<p>2. Reports of superintendents and teachers as to
how they do it, or reports of the destitution, wants,
or difficulties.</p>

<p>3. Instruction by the conductor to meet the above
specific wants and difficulties.</p>

<p>4. Questions by teachers and answers by the conductor
to meet the points in the subject not fully explained.</p>

<p>5. Preparation lessons, practice lessons, and model
lessons.</p>

<p>6. Explanatory and instructive addresses, lectures
or essays.</p>

<p>7. Model Opening Exercises and Teachers' Meetings.</p>

<p>8. Drill exercises on activity, curiosity, inquisitiveness;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
or how to gain attention, how to instruct,
how to impress, etc.</p>

<p><i>Every one</i> should take some part in an Institute,
<i>i. e.</i>, take notes, ask or answer questions, or give information
or lessons. Let none be mere spectators.
Always have plenty of paper for taking notes, also
pencils, and provide a good blackboard and crayons,
and perhaps a map, together with a good warm,
light and pleasant room to meet in.</p>

<p>Get up the Institute with care. Have it all well
understood, and then talk about it, write and print
about it, and get teachers and pastors pledged to attend.
Pray much for the Institute, and select the
best time, and do all that you undertake to do, thoroughly
and well. Let one subject naturally glide
into the succeeding one. Waste no time with outside
men or topics, but adhere to your programme
religiously. One or two good helpers from abroad
are sufficient, and do not invite men out of compliment.
Guard well all denominational interests and
feelings. Draw together in harmony and conciliate.
Never become opinionated or dogmatic, for the moment
we cease to learn, our usefulness will decline.
Give change, variety and life to all the exercises.</p>

<p>Finally, the spirituality of any Sunday-school
gathering must be earnestly sustained, or all will be
in vain. God alone can make a good superintendent,
or a good Sabbath-school teacher. We are as nothing.
The cause only is great. Therefore, with
the Word of God in our hands, let <i>all things</i> be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
done in a sense of real heartfelt dependence upon
God, and with earnest, believing supplication for the
Divine direction and blessing.</p>

<p>Many of our Sabbath-school Conventions and Institutes
are now very properly assuming a mixed
character, combining whatever is wanted of both, in
every meeting. We need to arouse, instruct and
train; and also to know the details of "how to do it."
May the Master control all these gatherings to His
glory and the good of man!</p>

<h3><i>Rules.</i></h3>

<p>1. Draw out the people to explain their wants,
experience, and difficulties.</p>

<p>2. Then supply their wants.</p>

<p>3. Get one conductor, pay his expenses, and assign
him to a good, quiet, comfortable place of entertainment
near the church.</p>

<p>4. Commence promptly, and keep strictly to the
programme and to time.</p>

<p>The following programme of an Institute we think
most useful. It should be sent out two to four weeks
in advance of the time of meeting:</p>

</div>

<p>If no meeting is held on Tuesday evening, then
drop out Thursday afternoon's exercises, and close up
with the others. It is of the utmost importance that
the pastors, superintendents, and teachers attend <i>all
the exercises</i>. The Institute has an opportunity on
every topic. Perhaps some pastor will favor with a
model-lesson or drill-exercises on the subjects presented.</p>

<p>We need "line upon line" on some very important
points, and, therefore, it is hoped that the <i>repetition</i>
of some of these subjects in these articles will
prove useful to many.</p>

<h2>V.<br />
THE SUPERINTENDENT.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE whole character and influence of a Sabbath-school
will depend largely upon the character and adaptedness of the superintendent.
What the superintendent of a railroad, or the
superintendent of a factory, or the commander of an
army is, each in his place, so is the superintendent
to his Sabbath-school. It is not every truly good
and pious man, nor even every talented or eloquent
man, who will make a good superintendent of a
Sabbath-school. Sometimes the modest and retiring
person, who shrinks from the acceptance of so holy an
office, makes the best superintendent. Neither is it
always the wisest or most influential man whom the
office wants, but the one who can the most readily
command the confidence and co-operation of the
pastor, parents and church members, as well as the
teachers and the children. Of course, the <i>best</i> man
in the church, next to the pastor, should always be
prayerfully called to the office, for it is difficult to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
raise a Sabbath-school higher than its superintendent.</p>

<p>The superintendent should have good executive,
business talents; energy; perseverance; self-control;
tact to govern; a love for children; devotion to the
cause; a warm, sympathetic heart; a life-like, serious,
yet cheerful manner; and, superadded to humble,
ardent piety, an ability to think, and to set others to
thinking; and withal, he should be able to express
himself clearly, briefly, and forcibly. He should
never allow the least harsh or irritable expression to
escape from him, and he should repress every symptom
of lightness, stiffness, or discouragement, remembering
that his look and manner will give tone to
the whole school.</p>

<p>He should know personally, and by name, and as
far as may be, the particular character of every teacher
and pupil in the school; speak to them, and always
treat them with confidence and respect&mdash;neither too
coldly, nor too familiarly&mdash;and assure them each of
his <i>personal</i> interest in them, and respect for them all.</p>

<p>He should be wise to discern, select, and adjust
proper teachers to their places, classify and arrange
the scholars, and in these things he should not be
overborne in his judgment. He is usually chosen by
the teachers annually, and will do well to take them
for his counsellors, and often consult them, collectively
and individually; for while he is the superintendent,
the head of the school, and as such a cheerful
obedience should be tendered to him by all, yet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
he is <i>not the sovereign</i>. His authority is not magisterial
nor parental, but he is a <i>constitutional</i> ruler,
governed himself by the rules of the school; and he
should so rule that no one should ever question his
right to govern. He should never even speak of
his "rights."</p>

<p>He should be <i>spiritually qualified</i> for his work,
and should become a holier man of God from the
hour in which he first receives the "call." He
should be in daily communion with God about the
work, talking freely with Him on all that concerns
the school, about every teacher, and about
every scholar, and humbly watching for answers to
his prayers.</p>

<p>He should also engage in the work with a good
measure of scriptural <i>enthusiasm</i>. We do well to
be very earnest and full of life, to be glowing and animated
in our looks, words, and actions, if we would
effectually reach the children, who are so full of life.
Perhaps the word unction would more worthily express
the idea. The superintendent's interest should
rise to this high point.</p>

<p>He should maintain good <i>discipline and order</i>,
both for himself and his school. Sometimes the most
disorderly man in the whole school is the superintendent.
The two elements of good order are self-control
and good temper. Let no man think he can
control others unless he can control himself. It will
be in vain for him to insist on order, punctuality, and
regard to all the rules of the school, unless he himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
is a living example of strict conformity to them
all. When he calls the school to order, let him
always wait patiently, in silence, until every teacher,
every scholar, officer and visitor, is in <i>perfect</i> order,
before he names a hymn or proceeds to do the least
thing.</p>

<p>He should also be <i>disinterested</i>, and never overshadow
his teachers. They are the great workers,
and his great work is to help the teachers in the
teaching. He should not <i>forestall</i> or <i>overshadow</i>
the teacher's work by an exposition of the lesson at
the opening of the school, so as to leave the teachers
nothing to do but to glean after the superintendent.
His remarks and reviews of the lesson should usually
come <i>after</i> the teachers have taught the lesson.</p>

<p>He should likewise <i>sincerely respect</i> all his
teachers, and treat them accordingly. Especially
should he respect the weakest and most inefficient
of his teachers. He will have the more to do to aid
them, and he must needs visit, counsel, suggest and
instruct them often. I have always found it better
to elevate and improve inefficient teachers than to dismiss
them.</p>

<p>The superintendent should also be a man of good
<i>executive ability</i>; and this is a very rare possession.
He needs much discerning power, as well as organizing
and combining talent, so as to keep pastor
and people, parents, teachers, and scholars, all harmoniously
at work. As Dr. James W. Alexander
used to say: "That man who can well superintend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a Sabbath-school can command an army;" and a
well-known bishop has said, that "the man who
can organize a good mission-school can organize a
diocese."</p>

<p>Again: The Sunday-school superintendent should
always have a <i>spirit</i> and <i>temper</i> such as will be
safe to diffuse throughout the school. Says the Rev.
S. Martin: "If he stands at the desk like a cold,
snow-capped mountain, or floats about the school
like a majestic iceberg, the whole atmosphere of the
school will be cold." If he is warm and genial, such
will be the school. A cheerful superintendent spreads
cheerfulness throughout the school. A light and
trifling, or a gloomy and morose, superintendent infects
teachers and scholars alike with the same spirit.
Never should the superintendent allow the least impatience
or harshness to manifest itself in his look,
tone of voice, or manner in the school; for its effects
will prove most disastrous. Ill-temper is a perfect
barrier to religious improvement and usefulness.</p>

<p>He should also be a decided, <i>positive</i> character;
not fitful, obstinate, heady, but strong in purpose,
strong in resolution, strong in the Lord. The boys
in the streets never choose any but positive characters
for leaders. A merely nominal superintendent
is a curse to a school, as is a weak, foolish mother, or
father, in the family.</p>

<p>Further, he should study to gather hints and suggestions
to help the teachers not only in the school,
but also in the teachers' meetings and everywhere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Particularly should he observe the teachers during
the teaching hour, and never interrupt them, but be
ready at any moment to come to their assistance.
He should always <i>protect</i> the teachers while teaching,
and not allow the librarian, or secretary, or missionary
collector, to appear on the floor at that time.</p>

<p>It will be seen from these points that the superintendent
needs great <i>general strength of character</i>.
Willow will do for a basket, but it requires oak and
iron for a man-of-war. Never are the teachers called
to a more important duty than when they prayerfully
cast their votes for the election of superintendent.
No personal favoritism or interest or prejudice
should be allowed for a single moment to prevail.</p>

<p>If I am here asked, "Do you know of any such
superintendents as are here described?" I must reply
in the negative. I have endeavored to embody in
the above list of qualifications all the best things of
the best superintendents whom I have seen during
the last forty-five years. Nevertheless, the things
which are here detailed have their counterparts in
some of them. The standard is raised high, so that
the true artist can copy after the great masters. Let
none be discouraged. The best superintendents now
living were very distrustful of their qualifications,
and shrank from the responsibility at the first call.
If God calls a man to a field of labor, he is abundantly
competent to fit him for working in it. Then "not
unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy name
give glory."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Duties of the Superintendent.</i></h3>

<p>Let us look now at some of the <i>duties</i> of the good
Sabbath-school superintendent.</p>

<p><i>Before school</i> he will, of course, prepare his mind,
by meditation and prayer, for his duties; he will
faithfully study the lesson, select the hymns and
Scripture lesson for the day, and carefully read them
and study them, until he has imbibed so much of their
spirit as to be able to <i>feel</i> them, and to express that
feeling while reading them before the school. He
will, also, prepare his notices, and arrange for all
special duties. All the teachers, with the superintendent,
ought to enjoy a twenty-minute prayer-meeting
before the hour to open the school, with two-minute
direct prayers, one or two verses of singing
at a time, and then only one or two selections of warm,
appropriate verses of Scripture truth. We would
characterize the requirements of such a meeting by
these words&mdash;<i>Impressive</i>, <i>Interesting</i>, <i>Devout</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Opening Exercises.</i>&mdash;The good superintendent
will always be punctual in opening, and at the
precise minute calmly, but clearly and naturally, call
the school to order. Having done this, he will never
proceed farther until every teacher, scholar, secretary,
librarian, or visitor <i>is in order</i>. He will remember
that every eye is on <i>him</i> for an example, and he will
take no liberty himself with the rules of the school.
When perfect silence and complete attention are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
gained, he will deliberately read the hymn and see that
all sing, about two or three verses; then read impressively
the lesson for the day, if not more than from ten
to fifteen verses, or alternate with the school in reading
if preferable. Be careful to mind all the stops
and read in clear, impressive tones, so that the reading
of the Scriptures by the school will be almost as
musical as singing. All will then unite in prayer
with the superintendent, one of the teachers, the pastor,
or a visitor present, who may be called upon;
this prayer should be short and to the point, and in
short sentences and in children's language. Have the
children join in and repeat the prayer, broken up
into sentences of four or five words each. Thus
teach the children how to pray. The whole of
the opening exercises should not usually exceed
fifteen minutes. The school will then be given
into the hands of the teachers, to proceed with the
lesson.</p>

<p><i>During Teaching.</i>&mdash;The superintendent will then
quietly supply every vacant class with a teacher, or
unite it with another class which has a teacher, so that
every scholar may be placed at once, temporarily, at
least, in charge of some one, and that no one may be
suffered to be idle. Next, he will check off the names
of teachers present on his roll-book; and then proceed
to receive the new scholars, learn their names,
residence, parents; gain their confidence; ascertain
whether they do not now belong to some other good
school; inform them of the character and order of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the Sunday-school, and assign them a place, temporary
or permanent, in a class. He will then pass
quietly and discreetly around the room, recognizing
the teachers and scholars as far as may be, without
interrupting or embarrassing them, assisting any
teacher who may need it to restore order and harmony,
or to gain the attention of any volatile youth
in the class. With the approval of the teacher, he
will occasionally examine the class, notice all disturbing
elements in the school, the adaptedness, or
otherwise, of the teachers for the particular classes
in their charge; occasionally recommending and
handing an appropriate book from the library to a
teacher or scholar, and calling especial attention to
it for their profit. The Bible classes and infant
classes will be timely noticed, and all strangers and
visitors greeted with a courteous, Christian welcome.
Suitable suggestions will be made to the secretary
and librarian; any call for assistance or explanation
will be given to any teacher; and thus, in every appropriate,
unobtrusive way, he will do whatever he
can to facilitate the work of all, while hindering
none.</p>

<p>Superintendents should be very cautious whom
they invite to address the school, and particularly
strangers of whom they know but little, only that
they are called very good men. Few persons can
address a Sunday-school with profit; and certainly,
without important reasons, the teachers should not
be interrupted in their regular duties; for the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
allotted to them is <i>theirs</i>, and even the superintendent
has <i>no right</i> to take it to oblige a friend.</p>

<p><i>Closing the School.</i>&mdash;At the appointed moment
the superintendent will call the school again to order,
to sing over a verse of a hymn in harmony with the
lesson; and then the superintendent may occupy not
to exceed five or ten minutes in a clear, well-digested
exposition of, or some pertinent remarks or questions
upon, the prominent points or teachings of the lesson.
Unless he can succeed in interesting and fixing
the attention of both teachers and scholars with
thoughts not ordinarily dwelt upon by the teachers,
he had better not attempt this exercise; for few evils
are greater in a school than a superintendent who
talks too much. Many of our best and most successful
and acceptable superintendents never attempt to
address their schools, except to give their notices and
necessary directions in a clear, orderly, business-like
way, and then stop at once. An opportunity is then
given, to distribute the library books and papers, give
out the next week's lesson, sing a verse or two of the
selected hymn, or with a prayer dismiss the school in
regular order.</p>

<p><i>After the school</i> the superintendent will receive
any suggestions or requests from teachers or scholars;
see that everything is left in its place; review the
events of the school, and note down all his plans for
improvement, and begin to study his next lesson.</p>

<p><i>During the week</i> he will remember that his duties
as superintendent do not close with the Sabbath, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
monthly concert, or teachers' meeting. Every day
he regards the Sabbath-school as his great field of
labor in the moral vineyard. Let us follow him, and
we shall see him on <i>Monday morning</i> on his way
to his regular business, when as he meets little Johnny
Smith, who, he remembers, was not in his place
in school yesterday, he very pleasantly inquires the
reason. On the corner of the next street he comes
across an absent teacher, and similar inquiries ensue.
On his return home at evening he sees in the distance,
in company with a lot of street-girls, Mary
Jones, and he hastens to her, takes her aside with
him, and learns the reason of her leaving school
some weeks before, together with other facts in her
history, which call out kind words of caution for the
wayward child, and he leaves her with the warm assurance
of her return. In the evening he is at the
monthly concert of prayer for Sabbath-schools, and
drops a few earnest remarks about the children,
which have such an effect upon two mothers present
that they go home and become more faithful thenceforth
in their Christian duty to their beloved little ones.</p>

<p>On the way, <i>Tuesday</i>, he stops in a few moments
to see a teacher who appeared quite perplexed and
disheartened on the Sabbath by the restlessness, inattention,
or indifference of her class. He noticed
last Sabbath that that teacher could only interest
the class for a few minutes. On looking over the
next week's lesson he is reminded of that teacher
and one of her scholars. The next morning he calls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
for a moment upon her on his way to business, and
says: "Miss S&mdash;&mdash;, there is one verse of the lesson
that I think can be used with advantage with one of
your scholars&mdash;Frank Jones." He explains it to the
teacher, and gives her an illustration or two. What
has he done? He has given that teacher the first real
idea she ever had of teaching Bible truth aright,
and she goes to her class the next Sabbath a new
teacher, and never loses the influence in future life.
He soon succeeds in dispelling the cloud, and causing
a cheerful light to shine on her path of duty.</p>

<p>On <i>Wednesday evening</i> he steps over to consult
the pastor about the best way of turning the hearts
of parents to their children, and to arouse the church
in <i>sympathetic</i> efforts on behalf of the lambs of the
flock.</p>

<p>On <i>Thursday morning</i> he takes an hour before,
or an interval of business, to explore a desperate
neighborhood, and succeeds beyond his expectations
in exciting interest and enlisting recruits for the Sunday-school
from among the juvenile portion of the
disorderly gang. He also takes occasion to call on
little Pat Lawless's mother, and is successful in getting
her pledge to co-operate with him in the attempt
to rescue her boy from untold depravity and almost
certain ruin. Pat is notoriously the ringleader in the
worst gang of boys in the neighborhood, and every
body was surprised to see little Harry Page leading
him into the Sunday-school for the first time on the
last Sabbath morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
On his way back from business, <i>Friday</i> evening,
he calls for a few minutes on an intelligent young
Christian who recently came into the place, in order
to seek his Christian acquaintance, and invite him to
look up for himself a class of scholars from the neglected
neighborhood he visited the day before, and
he succeeds in inducing him to bring into the school
and teach a fine class of street-boys the way of life;
he takes a hint from the conversation with his young
friend, and concludes to get up a neat printed certificate
of reward to the pupils for bringing in new
scholars. In the weekly prayer-meeting he has a
word about the school, just enough to enlist their
sympathies and their prayers.</p>

<p><i>Saturday morning</i>, on opening the daily paper
or a book, he sees a striking providence, an interesting
fact or incident of life, which, he remembers at
once, will aptly illustrate or enforce an important
truth in the lesson for the next Sabbath, and carefully
notes it down and <i>thinks</i> it over, and in the
evening we find him full of hope and interest at the
teachers' meeting. Thus closes his labors for the
week. It is <i>only</i> a week! but how valuable is that
life of which this is but a week!</p>

<p>Now, all this is no mere fancy sketch. We have
had living superintendents&mdash;not <i>one</i> but all together&mdash;sitting
for the portrait here drawn, and whose lives
have supplied all the illustrations, and who pursue a
somewhat similar course every week, and on every
returning Sabbath-day. Thus, without scarcely an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
hour's interference with his duties to his family, his
business, or the public, the good superintendent has
found time, and has been enabled every day during
the week, to do something for the Sunday-school,
simply because he loves it; his heart is on it, and he
loves constantly to devise ways of doing good by it.
He never expects to be, and he never will be, satisfied
with the school as it is; but, however great the progress,
he will keep his mind actively at work to plan
improvements in the arrangement, the order, the discipline,
the enterprise, or the teaching, and thus, <i>Upward
and Onward</i>, will be his perpetual motto.</p>

<p>A stagnant business, he knows, will soon droop
and die.</p>

<h2>VI.<br />
THE LIBRARY AND LIBRARIAN.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capW-053.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE have a very high appreciation of the value
of a good Sabbath-school library. It seems
to me that no form of circulating sound religious
reading is superior. The books, however,
require to be selected and adapted with the greatest
care. This is certainly a difficult matter, but the
object to be attained is so great as to reward the
effort. Many schools are now flooded with the most
vicious, improper books. There is no justifiable excuse
for this. Never were there so many good books
for children and youth as now. Several hundreds
that teach the soundest Christian morals and are true
to life, and filled with the soundest evangelical Bible
instruction, can now be selected. There is scarcely
a shadow of excuse at the present time for admitting
even a doubtful book into our Sabbath-school libraries&mdash;unless
some will accept the plea of ignorance and
laziness. Our children's minds should be as sacredly
guarded from poisonous books as their bodies from
poisonous drugs. There should be a judicious standing
committee in every school to select library books,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
while the pastor should always carefully revise their
selection.</p>

<p>The books of the Sabbath-school library must be
attractive and interesting, or they will not be read by
the young. They must be true to life and fact, or
they will prove pernicious. They must be instructive,
or they should find no place in the library. They
should be adapted to awaken, convict and convert,
to nourish in the religious life and morals, and throw
light upon all the pathway of everyday practical
life, or they will fall short of meeting the great want.
They must strictly conform in all things to the Bible
standard, or they should never be found in any of our
Sabbath-school libraries.</p>

<p>Better have no books than to have unsound ones.
Spare no pains to procure an abundance of good,
sound, attractive, and useful reading, and we will
soon drive away the flood of bad books which is now
threatening to destroy our youth. <i>Several copies</i> of
superior books should be placed in the library at the
same time. Select such as are adapted to all ages
and conditions, from the children in the infant-school
up to the wide-awake young men and women in our
highest adult Bible classes, and to teachers. Let
them also cover all stages of religious feeling and
want. Books of narrative, history, biography, youthful
Christian experience and training, on temperance,
good morals, good habits and manners, should all be
provided for the thorough religious instruction of
our children and youth. The library should also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
comprise a good teacher's library with good reference
Bibles, a Concordance and Dictionary. Then
give the books the largest, freest and most active
circulation.</p>

<p><i>Managing the Library.</i>&mdash;In a great many Sabbath-schools
the manner of distributing the books is
a very bad one, and in consequence of this some
schools have improperly discarded the library altogether.
The great difficulty has arisen from the fact
that the librarian has been allowed to be on the floor
and have access to and interrupt the teachers during
the teaching hour. This should never be allowed.
An interruption to the teacher while applying divine
truth may peril souls for ever, and therefore should
be carefully guarded. The only access to the teachers
which the librarian ought to be allowed during
school hours is to simply hand them the books, just
at the close of school. There are several good systems
for distributing the books that conform to this
idea and protect the teachers. I would never ask
the teachers to write the scholars' names or numbers
for books, or do the work of selection, during the
school hours.</p>

<p>In the management of the library, what is called
"The Check System" is considered one of the best.
We cannot describe the various good plans, but I
will detail one which seems to me to be more simple
and to obviate more difficulties than any other that I
am acquainted with. It first provides a carefully-printed
numerical catalogue of all the books, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the number of pages. Give to each scholar one
of these catalogues, and replace it when lost. If
the school is a small district-school, a written catalogue
will answer the purpose equally well. Then
a "Library Card," four inches by two-and-a-half
inches, is provided for each scholar on the first
of each month. On this is written or printed&mdash;"Library
Card," "Class No. 6," "John Smith." Each
scholar takes his "Library Card" and catalogue
home, and there, with aid from his parents or a
friend, he selects from ten to fifteen books, either
of which he will be satisfied with during the next
four weeks. The "Library Card" is then placed in
his book, and kept there as a marker, and is returned
to the librarian on the next Sabbath with the book.
Each scholar hands his book, with the card in it, as
he enters the room, to the librarian, who is always
to be found at the opening of the school at the outer
door of the school-room, with a large basket ready
to receive all the books from the pupils. When
the school is opened the librarian carries these
books to the library and assorts them, as he ascertains
from each book-mark to whom and what class
and name the book belongs. The book is then credited
as returned, and the new one charged. If any
scholar wants one book particularly that is on his
list, he <i>underscores</i> it, and if it is in the library, it
is given to him and charged. If any scholar is late,
and the librarian has gone to the library, he loses his
exchange of books on that Sabbath. The librarian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
keeps the account of all library-books, and charges
them all to each name and class according to the
book-mark, and credits them when returned, and the
teacher has no care of it. After the teaching is closed,
the lesson reviewed by the superintendent, remarks
made, prayer, singing, etc., then the librarian, by a notice
from the superintendent, passes down the aisle and
hands each teacher his lot of books, and the teacher
passes them to each pupil according to the library
card, and then the school is dismissed. No scholar
opens his library-book or paper in the school. The
teachers have no care of the books or their numbers,
unless the scholar loses his library-card; in which
case his teacher, at the close of the school, accompanies
him to the library and obtains for him a new
library-card and book. The librarian and his assistant
charge and credit all the books while the
teachers are teaching. Each class has a column or
place in the register. This plan satisfies the scholar,
he has his own choice, and never interrupts the
teachers or the school for a moment, or diverts the
attention of the school, and no time is lost. It
works admirably.</p>

<p><i>The Librarian.</i>&mdash;The librarian's office is an important
one. He should be one of the most considerate,
watchful, careful young men in all the community,
for his office gives him much prominence.
He should open the library, arrange it in order, distribute
hymn and class-books before the school opens,
and allow no unauthorized person access to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
library. He will become acquainted with the general
character of the books, as well as know the
scholars, that he may intelligently aid them in their
selections. He will, also, ascertain what class of
books is most in demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS indispensable officer of the school is a
sort of clerk or helper to the superintendent.</p>

<p>1. He should be a good accountant, prompt,
watchful and attentive. He should keep a record of
the attendance.</p>

<p>2. He should make a note of the opening exercises,
with the names of those who participate, and
any interesting circumstances connected with them.</p>

<p>3. He should record the names of all the scholars
and teachers who have been or are now connected
with the school, and note everything of their changes
in life and history, especially their profession of
religion, marriage, etc.&mdash;keeping up a correspondence
with them. This record-book will become very
valuable as the years roll on, since it includes parents'
names, every removal and death, etc., etc.</p>

<p>4. He will also count the number of scholars and
teachers present, enter it in the minute-book, and
note the absentees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
5. He should write up the class-books, and deliver
them to the teachers.</p>

<p>6. He should enter in the minute-book the names
of visitors, especially if the pastor be one of them;
note the addresses, what kind of weather, and all
items affecting the school.</p>

<p>7. He should give certificates of dismissal to every
teacher or scholar about removing to another place,
recommending them to the Christian fellowship of
those who love Christ's lambs.</p>

<p>8. He should know every scholar, so that he can
check them off without asking the teacher the name,
and should have a quick, vigilant eye, not only for
his own duties, but, also, in order to communicate
valuable suggestions respecting the school to the
superintendent.</p>

<p>9. In the absence of the superintendent, he may
sometimes take his place in the charge of the school,
except in the case of very large schools, which may
require an assistant to the superintendent.</p>

<h2>VIII.<br />
THE TEACHER.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE true Sabbath-school teacher is one called
and "sent of God;" for we read (1&nbsp;Cor. xii.&nbsp;28),
"And God hath set some in the church,
first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly <i>teachers</i>;"
and the same divine lips which said "Go preach," said
also "Go teach." Whosoever receives this sacred call
should devote himself to it by a holy consecration,
remembering that he is truly an ambassador from the
King of kings to a small circle of his rebellious subjects,&mdash;a
ransomed sinner offering pardon to precious
youth condemned to die. His great business is the
preparation of young immortals for the kingdom of
heaven through the application of heaven-revealed
truth by a simple appeal to their intelligence and
feelings through the power of the Holy Spirit. This
is truly an angel's errand entrusted to redeemed sinners.
Mr. Groser justly says: "The office of a
Christian teacher transcends all others in interest and
importance. No matter what his precise sphere of
labor may be, whether that of a professor like Chalmers,
a pastor like Oberlin, a schoolmaster like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Arnold, or a Sunday-school teacher like the 300,000
men and women who on each returning Sabbath
seek to instruct our youth in those truths which are
able to make them wise unto salvation." He should,
therefore, accept his mission thankfully, and enter
upon it heartily, and attend to his duties punctually,
faithfully, and earnestly.</p>

<p>He is to teach Bible truth. That is the divinely
provided aliment for the human mind, and if rightly
taught and received it will be attractive and satisfying
to the soul, and all besides will be only supplementary.
To be able to teach Bible truth thus
faithfully and truly, calls for <i>hard</i>, <i>earnest</i> work, for,
says one of the English bishops, "It takes all we
know to make things plain." The teacher, therefore,
must needs be well furnished and thoroughly fitted
for his high calling.</p>

<p>This brings us to the next article, on the teacher's
preparation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

<h2>IX.<br />
PREPARATION.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE work of teaching divine truth is so difficult
and important that every teacher should
do himself the justice to make the most clear
and careful preparation. No teacher can impart
more than he has prepared to teach, and he should
therefore bring to his class only beaten oil, well-digested
and well-adapted thoughts, something worthy
of being taught, and that will command attention for
their own sake. It is well for the teacher to have
method and system, as well as a set time and place
to begin that preparation. The time to commence,
we think, should be on the afternoon or evening of
the previous Sabbath, and the place in the quiet of the
home circle or the study.</p>

<p>1. Pray and read, and read and <i>think</i> and <small>PRAY</small>
over the lesson; the words and the spirit of it. Here
look for the best thoughts to use.</p>

<p>2. Search the Scriptures with the aid of a Concordance,
or good reference Bible, for the most
pointed and practical parallel passages and references;
they will wonderfully illuminate the lesson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
3. By aid of the Bible references, and a good dictionary,
be careful to get the clear, exact meaning of
the important words of the lesson, in words adapted
to your class.</p>

<p>4. Next use your Teachers' Helps, Commentaries,
Bible Geographies, Bible Dictionaries, Maps, Antiquities,
etc.</p>

<p>5. Go out into the world and gather excellent
things for illustration of the Bible truth from what
you see, hear, read or do.</p>

<p>6. Visit your scholars' homes in the preparation
of your lessons, and learn their peculiar trials and
temptations. Study well your children, child-nature
and child-language, "Peep of Day" and "Line
upon Line" are pure specimens of child-language.</p>

<p>7. Get something for <i>each</i> pupil, for Johnny is not
at all like Willy, and Willy is not like Charlie, etc.
Break up Bible truths into small pieces for the children
and youth. Do not wander afar for simile, but
remember "knowledge is <i>before</i> him that understandeth,
but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the
earth."</p>

<p>8. Make full notes, write out your facts and references,
etc.: (<i>a</i>) Of your best thoughts. (<i>b</i>) Of your
best plan of teaching. (<i>c</i>) The aim and object of
the lesson illustrations. (<i>d</i>) Of the commencement
and closing of the teaching lesson.</p>

<p>9. Think it all over so carefully and repeatedly
that you will need scarcely to look at the notes to the
end. Select just what to teach, and do not stuff the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
children. Memorize the lesson and you will have
special unction in teaching.</p>

<p>10. Prepare more, far more, than you will want to
use, that you may have ample material for selections;
for no teacher can impart all that he is prepared to
teach, and the teacher should be careful <small>NEVER TO
EXHAUST HIMSELF</small>.</p>

<p>Finally. Do not be tied down to any one plan or
method of preparing a Sabbath lesson, but invent
new and fresh modes. Never suffer any part of your
preparation or teaching to relapse into a dull routine.
Be fresh, warm, and earnest in manner and matter,
and raise yourself above leaning upon any question-books
or notes of lessons; use them if you please,
but do not lean upon them. The weekly teachers'-meeting
is an indispensable assistant to every faithful
teacher. Never forget that the only sort of knowledge
which can answer a Sabbath-school teacher's
purpose "must be at once thorough, detailed, abundant,
and exact."</p>

<p>It is of the first importance that the teacher of
children should study well child-nature, child-language,
and all the child's characteristics&mdash;such as
activity, curiosity, inquisitiveness, etc.; what are its
wants and cares; its dangers and its duties; its hopes
and fears; its sympathies and feelings, likes and dislikes.
All these must be candidly considered if we
would prepare for the position of Christian counsellor
and guide to the child. We must gain its confidence,
draw out its sympathies, and win its heart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and all this will require the most diligent, earnest,
prayerful study. In this process the teacher must
needs often recall his own childhood, and live that
over again&mdash;become as a little child again&mdash;if he
would become a child's teacher. Do not ever fall
into the error of supposing that your children are
ever too young or too ignorant to appreciate a well-prepared
lesson.</p>

<p>After these very full directions for the <i>teacher</i>, I
am here permitted by Mr. Ralph Wells to give the
notes of his actual <i>superintendent's</i> preparation in
the regular service of Grace Mission-school, only one
week before the previous part of this article was
written. The following are his exact notes:</p>

<p>The simple notes certainly give but a faint idea of
how thoroughly hypocrisy is unmasked in this lesson.
The teacher or scholar will never forget it.
"<i>Intense</i> study" should be contrasted with the <i>easy</i>-chair,
lounging, intermitting study of many.</p>

<p>"The store, the bank," etc., refer to rum shops; so
named that husbands and young men who return at
late hours may say, I have just left "<i>the bank</i>," etc.</p>

<p>The "photograph of Absalom's monument" reminds
us that, to this day, every Jew casts a stone at
it, and curses the hypocrite's memory; and so on
with the other illustrations.</p>

<p class="gap-above">The following brief notes were taken at one of
our New York Association's meetings: Subject&mdash;How
to prepare a Sabbath-school lesson. "Piety
<i>alone</i> is not what we want in Sabbath-school teaching
any more than preaching." Take the lesson&mdash;Luke
xviii.&nbsp;35&mdash;"A certain blind man," etc. Take
a good Reference Bible and a Bible Dictionary.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
I ask myself, What is in this passage? A miracle.
Say something about miracles, but never lead a child
into deep water. I can never make a thing plain to
another that I cannot make plain to myself. You
cannot teach more than you can put into words, etc.</p>

<p>Tell them about a particular part of the country
Jericho (Josh. ii., and 2 Kings xvi.&nbsp;34), sixteen
miles from Jerusalem, and about six from the river
Jordan. I find here a beggar&mdash;<i>two</i>, but one is
silent. "Jesus, thou Son of David"&mdash;the sublime
epithet applied to the Messiah. His suit is for
mercy. "Cried the <i>more</i>"&mdash;evidence of faith&mdash;plea
for mercy&mdash;earnestness. Jesus is arrested in his
progress by the prayer of the needy man. Prayer
arrests all laws. Jesus stood and commanded. You
have got to come to Jesus. Submission to Jesus
absolutely essential. What wilt thou? We are to
tell Christ just what we want. Prayer is absolutely
necessary. Jesus made the blind man tell Him.
Revive thy faith. Must believe. How apply. What
last impressions to leave. Jesus was going up to
Jerusalem for the last time. Only opportunity, or
last opportunity. All go. This opportunity, dear
boys, may be the last.</p>

<p>The superintendent, as well as the teachers, needs
the most ample and careful preparation of the lesson,
in order to suggest and aid and sympathize with the
teachers and school, and to conduct the teachers'
meeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

THE TEACHER TEACHING.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE teacher is the master and superior, and
his character, attitude, bearing and words
should be well calculated to govern and to
guide. Teaching is not simply educating&mdash;namely,
drawing out, nor simply instructing the pupil, but
<i>training</i> him. It is taking my thought and converting
it to <i>his use</i>.</p>

<p>With this view great care should be taken to begin
a lesson aright. The teacher should come from
communion with God, and his spirit and manner
should be at once thoughtful, earnest and cheerful,
never cold, cheerless, indifferent, or severe. Let him
give to each scholar a warm, quiet, but hearty salutation;
be early, be calm, be gentle, be firm and seriously
in earnest; never allow any scholar to take any
undue liberties; and see that each one and everything
is in its place.</p>

<p>With interest and reverence the teacher and his
class will then enter upon the devotional opening exercises,
joining in them. After which he will gather
his class around him, and first place himself on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
terms of good-will with all, and find some <i>common
ground</i> for their minds to begin acting upon. A
well-timed, easy, and awakening question about the
former or present lesson will arrest attention, but it
must be well adapted, and readily answered. The
first questions must never perplex or embarrass the
pupil, for they are very important. From thence
proceed and rapidly draw their minds up towards
the great central thought of the lesson; awakening
thought, arousing curiosity, and deepening impressions.</p>

<p>The teacher should question the lesson <i>out</i> of the
pupils, and then question it <i>into</i> them. He will first
get the <i>words</i> of the lesson clearly into the minds of
the scholars&mdash;mostly by catechising&mdash;and then the
<i>meaning</i> and illustration of the principal words.
Next the <i>lessons</i> of instruction must be carefully
drawn, and lastly, <i>applied</i> to the heart and life of all.</p>

<p>A severe test comes upon the teacher in the recitation
and catechising upon the lesson. He is to
remember: 1. To draw all the information that he
can from the class; 2. To induce the class to find out
all they can for themselves; 3. To give such information
as is best for the class, but before giving any information,
be sure that no member of the class <i>can</i>
give it.</p>

<p>The true teacher starts from the <i>known</i>, and proceeds
over short and easy stepping-stones to the faintly
known, thence to the contrast, and then to the unknown.
Some very learned men utterly fail as teachers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
They take such tremendous strides that no pupil can
follow them. It is like the father rushing up three
steps at a time to the top of the staircase. If he would
lead his child, he must be careful to take but one step
at a time. Let the child's present knowledge be the
starting-point for all future acquisitions. Reading, or
even reciting, a lesson, may possibly teach nothing.
"'Tis in vain that you make them read the life and doctrines
of the Saviour, if you do not explain to them that
he lived for their example, that he died to redeem them,
and that those doctrines are to govern them in thought,
word and deed." Care should be taken, to select the
best plan of arranging the lesson. "The <i>beginning</i>
should arrest attention, the <i>middle</i> inform the mind,
and the <i>end</i> affect the heart." Let there be a natural
order and method in all your teaching;&mdash;one thought
gliding into and connecting with the next, and so on.
In no department of life is system and method of
more value, and a child is as much aided by it as a
man. Robertson justly says: "Memory without
method is useless. Detached facts are practically
valueless." Method is the laying out of the lesson
and proceeding in its natural order in conformity
with the uniform laws of the human mind. It tells
what shall come first and second, and puts everything
in its right place, so that the mind can take a clearer
grasp, and memory a more easy and a more retentive
hold, of the truths presented.</p>

<p>We should not, however, bind ourselves to any
<i>one</i> method of teaching, for there is no standard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
mode alike adapted to different persons and lessons.
The most of our good teachers have wrought out
some way of teaching in a measure peculiar to themselves
and adapted to them. Those who can do so,
however, will be able to borrow much of value from
"Gall's Lesson System," with its thorough analysis,
numerous exercises, exhaustive doctrines and lessons
of instruction, or from "Stow's Training System,"
with its sympathy of numbers, its picturing out into
life and training which will aid others, and "Mimpriss's
Gospel Harmony" will help many. Let us
ride no hobbies, but gather the best suggestions from
all for our Sabbath-school work.</p>

<p>What we want in our Sabbath-schools is to add
a sufficiency of teaching-power&mdash;to give efficacy to
our teaching without stiffening it with rules and
forms.</p>

<p>A few years ago hymn-learning, catechism, and
task-lessons formed the staple of even our Scripture-classes.
Now there is a demand for good Bible-teaching,
that will equal the teaching of our best
academies and colleges. The Bible is so adapted
and wonderful as to place us on great vantage
ground. We want to know, How to use it? Mr.
J. G. Fitch, of the Normal College, London, has
given us an admirable synopsis of the few simple
principles which underlie the great art, and which,
as he justly observes, "require to be pondered and
thoroughly grasped by every teacher:"</p>

<p>1. "Never to teach what you do not quite understand."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Clear knowledge makes clear, pleasant
teaching.</p>

<p>2. "Never to tell a child what you could make
that child tell you." He will thus remember it ten
times as long.</p>

<p>3. "Never to give a piece of information without
asking for it again." The mind cannot retain what
it does not expect to be called on for again, or to
have a future use for.</p>

<p>4. "Never to use a hard word if an easy one will
convey your meaning; and never to use any word at
all unless you are quite sure that it has a meaning to
convey." Mark&mdash;not "long" word, but "hard"
word.</p>

<p>5. "Never to begin an address, or a lesson, without
a clear view of its end." Then aim high and at the
mark.</p>

<p>6. "Never to give an unnecessary command, nor
one which you do not mean to see obeyed." Therefore,
few commands; for in case you fail to secure
obedience the child rules you, and not you the child.</p>

<p>7. "Never to permit a child to remain in the class
for a minute without something to do, and a motive
for doing it." A child wants something to do, and
cannot bear to be idle. Keep him busy.</p>

<p>Teaching is an art, and like any other art, it has to
be learned&mdash;learned, too, by study, observation, and
practice. It has its rules and principles. He who
knows and practises them is a good workman;
while he who neglects them is necessarily inefficient.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
First, we must get the ideas and <i>principles</i>. Secondly,
we must <i>imitate</i> or copy the good examples or
models; and thirdly, we are to practise teaching; for
the best way to learn how to teach is to <i>teach</i>. Said
Ralph Wells, when asked how he learned to teach,
"By my mistakes and failures." In teaching others
successfully we teach ourselves effectively.</p>

<p>In seeking after our models or examples to copy,
we need not, like the artist, go to Italy in order to
copy the great masters; for the great Master of
teaching&mdash;Christ, our Model Teacher and the teacher's
model&mdash;is always before us, and His example is
perfect. He is "the Teacher come from God."
"He spake as never man spake." Let us notice
some characteristics of His teaching:</p>

<p>1. He was <i>very instructive</i>. He knew what was
in man, and just how to meet his wants. If our words
do not instruct, they "are simply impertinent." Do
our "lips teach knowledge?"</p>

<p>2. He was <i>beautifully simple</i>,&mdash;child-like, but
never childish; so clear that all could understand.
So our words should be few, well-chosen, simple,
and adapted, softly and deliberately expressed.</p>

<p>3. His teaching was <i>highly illustrative</i>. So
should ours be. He gathered from all the common
surroundings of life. The tiny sparrow was made
to illustrate His care; He pointed the magi to the
stars; the fishermen were to be fishers of men; He
taught a lesson to the merchant-man from the goodly
pearl; the water-bearer was offered the water of life;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
while the wheat, the grain, the tares, the chaff, the
vine, the tree, the field, and almost every object
taught the husbandman amid his daily toil. Heaven
itself is represented by earthly things and objects the
most valued&mdash;by "songs," "arches," "harps of gold,"
"rivers clear as crystal," "rivers of pleasure,"
"pearly gates," "precious rubies and stones," etc.
His illustrations always threw <i>light</i> upon truth&mdash;never
<i>displaced</i> it, as ours sometimes do. They
were drawn from everyday life, and so well adapted
that they were joyfully received by the candid inquirer.
Let all Sabbath-school teachers herein copy
the Master. Apt illustrations render truth more permanent;
for it is well said, that the "simile, the anecdote,
the fable, is sure to be remembered, and the
sentiment to which it was linked is sure to go with
it."</p>

<p>4. His teaching was, also, <i>sublimely courageous</i>.
"He spake as one having authority." His confidence
in God and in His truth raised Him above fear and
doubt.</p>

<p>5. His teaching was <i>singularly adapted</i>. It
always reached the heart and life.</p>

<p>6. His teaching was <i>mingled with prayer</i>. He
went out to teach; He retired to pray. Let all
teachers imitate His example.</p>

<p>7. His teaching was <i>closely applied</i>. Let our
teaching, also, be carried home to the everyday life
of the children, and applied closely, particularly,
personally, and privately to specific errors and sins;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
for we never should allow ourselves for a moment to
doubt that there is no infirmity in manner or purpose,
in habit, temper, or character, amongst our
children, which the Sunday-school, with its divine
text-book, is not abundantly competent to reach and
remove.</p>

<p>Sabbath-school teaching should combine at least&mdash;1.
The art of asking questions. 2. Keeping order.
3. The art of securing attention and interesting the
pupils. 4. The drawing of practical lessons and applying
them to the daily, common life. We should
never undertake to teach a truth of which we cannot
see and make plain its uses; certainly never convey
to our children the idea that there is any unimportant
portion of revealed truth. One or two Bible-truths
and principles are generally better than many.</p>

<p>The art of drawing lessons is much more simple
and easy even for children than most persons think.
The only prerequisites for drawing practical lessons
are&mdash;1. A knowledge of the facts. 2. An accurate
perception whether they be good or evil. If the
action or precept be good, the practical lesson is but
an echo of the fact; if evil, avoid. Imitate the
good and shun the evil. For instance: Cain and
Abel were industrious; from which we learn the
duty to be industrious. Cain and Abel went up to
worship God; from which learn to copy their good
example in going to worship God. But Cain became
angry and slew his brother; from which we
draw the lesson of warning and danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Another important part of a teacher's work may be
found in Mr. Fitch's third rule, <i>i. e.</i>, Every teacher
before he leaves the lesson, should carefully call back
in a child's own language all that he has taught him.
Without this careful, thorough review and <i>recapitulation</i>
he cannot be sure that his instructions and the
practical lessons taught are really received. A child
is, as it were, compelled to remember what he is
sure to be called upon for again; so that we can
hardly overestimate the value of review and recapitulation.
One superintendent in New York recently
reviewed, by aid of a blackboard, the whole of
John's Gospel with his scholars on two consecutive
Sabbaths. The teacher should keep his eyes upon
all the class, and address the class generally more
than the individual members of the class; but be
ready to sympathize with each and all.</p>

<p>Never be in a hurry with the lesson; calmly, patiently,
candidly proceed. It is far better to get the
pupils to <i>understand</i> the first verse or a single
thought of the lesson, and proceed no farther, than
to hasten over a dozen verses.</p>

<p>Paul says: "I had rather speak five words with
my understanding, that by <i>my voice</i> I might <i>teach</i>
others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown
tongue." (1&nbsp;Cor. xiv.&nbsp;19.) Be strictly impartial; have
no favorites in the school; be tenderly respectful to
the weaker ones. Particular care should be taken to
preserve order fully until the <i>close</i> of the school, for
then it becomes most difficult; and after the school
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
he will retire to his closet and commend his feeble,
imperfect labors in prayer to God. He will ask himself
the following questions: "Does any child leave
me to-day with a clear, simple view of <i>one truth</i> of
the gospel of Jesus Christ?" and, "Is it a matter perfectly
understood between me and my pupils to-day
that I am seeking their conversion to God at <i>this
time</i>, and under my instructions?" He will then think
over the events of the hour, and commence his
preparation for his next lesson. During the week
the Sabbath-school teacher will find something to do
every day. On one evening he will visit an absentee,
or look up a new scholar; on another, visit
some of the parents; then attend a social meeting, or
the teachers' meeting, and on another call to interest
one to become a new teacher. He gets one boy a
place to work, and another he introduces into the
public school; gives his scholars his name and residence
on a card, and endeavors in all ways to prove
himself to be a warm-hearted, sympathizing Christian
friend.</p>

<p>The teacher's life is the life of his teaching. His
character, manners, habits, dress, and associations, all
exert an influence of great power upon his pupils
and upon his fellow-teachers; and he will do well to
adopt the noble, disinterested Christian motto': "If
meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh
while the world standeth;" or if the theatre, or
dancing, or tobacco, or the wine-cup, or cards, or
any minor evil, lessen my influence as a Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
teacher, I will cheerfully abandon them at once and
for ever. "Be ye holy in all manner of conversation
and godliness."</p>

<h3><i>Examples of Teaching.</i></h3>

<p>In appending some examples or lessons in teaching,
I have selected two varieties from the "Gall" or
"Lesson System," of which the late James Gall, of
Edinburgh, was the author. I have done so, first,
because it is a <i>system</i> and conforms to all good rules
of teaching; secondly, because, having used it for more
than a quarter of a century, I have found it to be of
more value to the teacher and interest to the children
than any or all others, if varied and <i>adapted</i> with a
sound discretion; and, thirdly, because there are
more suggestions in it to teachers than any other; in
fact, it includes all others. Particular care must be
taken not to attempt too much. Never attempt to use
the whole <i>ten</i> exercises on any <i>one</i> Sabbath lesson,
or pursue the same order. Generally use the catechetical,
the explanations, and the lesson every Sabbath.
In some lessons five or six can be used. All
are suggestive.</p>

<p>The great leading principle of the system is to
teach <i>the use of knowledge</i>&mdash;not to communicate
information merely, but to train the young, by certain
definite rules, to <i>make use</i> of all the information
they receive. The first lesson here given is for
younger classes; the second for more advanced:</p>

<h4><i>Lesson No. 1.</i><br />
<i>As taught by the "Gall Lesson System."</i></h4>

<p class="center">(Matt. viii.&nbsp;1-3.)</p>

 <p>"When he was come down from the <i>mountain</i>, great <i>multitudes
 followed</i> him. And <i>behold</i>, there came a <i>leper</i> and
 <i>worshipped</i> him, saying, Lord, if thou <i>wilt</i> thou
 <i>canst</i> make me <i>clean</i>. And Jesus <i>put forth</i> his
 hand, and <i>touched</i> him, saying, I will; be thou <i>clean</i>.
 And <i>immediately</i> his <i>leprosy</i> was <i>cleansed</i>."</p>

 <p>Who came down from the mountain? From what did Jesus come down? What
 happened when Jesus came down from the mountain? Who followed him?
 Whom did the multitudes follow?</p>

 <p>Who came to Jesus? To whom did the leper come? What did the leper do
 when he came to Jesus? Whom did the leper worship? When did the leper
 worship Jesus? What did the leper call Jesus? Whom did the leper call
 Lord? What did the leper say? If who would? What could Jesus do if he
 would? What did the leper say Jesus could do? Who could make him
 clean?</p>

 <p>What did Jesus do? Who put forth his hand? What did Jesus put forth?
 What did Jesus do when he put forth his hand? Who touched him? Whom
 did Jesus touch? When did Jesus touch the leper? What did Jesus say?
 Who would? What was the leper to be? Who said he was to be clean?</p>

 <p>What happened when Jesus said he was to be clean? What was cleansed?
 Whose leprosy was cleansed? When was the man's leprosy cleansed? By
 whom was the man's leprosy cleansed?</p>

 <p>How many circumstances are mentioned in this passage? (Nine.) What is
 the first? (<i>Multitudes followed Jesus when he came down from the
 mountain.</i>) What does that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>

 opportunity of receiving his instructions.</p>

 <p>What is the second circumstance here mentioned? (<i>A leper came to
 Jesus to be healed of his leprosy.</i>) What does that teach you?
 <i>Lesson.</i>&mdash;We should apply to Jesus the Saviour to be healed of
 the leprosy of sin.</p>

<h4><i>Other Modes of Teaching.</i></h4>

<p>There are also various other modes of teaching
that can be used on different lessons. One plan is
to raise the questions Who? What? When? and
Where?</p>

<p>Another is to take the letters P. P. D. D. D. D.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the two P's and four D's, and inquire for <i>P-ersons</i>,
<i>P-laces</i>, <i>D-ates</i>, <i>D-oings</i>, <i>D-octrines</i>, and <i>D-uties</i>.</p>

<p>Another still is to take the word "<i>F-i-d-d-l-e-r</i>," as a
mnemonic for the teacher's use. The first letter, <i>F</i>,
will remind him to call on the children to tell him
what <i>facts</i>, and how many, are to be found in the
first verse or in the lesson. The next letter, <i>i</i>, may
prompt him to call for <i>inferences or instructions</i>.
The letter <i>d</i> repeated would remind him to ask for
the <i>doctrines</i> and <i>duties</i>, <i>l</i> will call for <i>lessons</i>, <i>e</i> for
<i>examples</i> and <i>r</i> for <i>rebukes</i>. This will give active
employment to the children&mdash;a thing which they
delight in, and it will aid the teacher in the difficult
but sublime work of teaching divine Truth.</p>

<h2>XI.<br />
ILLUSTRATIVE TEACHING.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TO illustrate is to throw light upon, to illumine,
to make clear and plain. Illustration
has, also, a decorating power as well as an
enlightening power.</p>

<p>Illustrative teaching is not merely entertaining
or amusing the children with stories and anecdotes,
but may comprise them incidentally. Explanation
appeals to the understanding, while illustration
appeals to the observation of the young. Says
one writer: "It is by illustration alone, which appeals
to their observation, that ideas are conveyed
to children's minds." Anecdotes and stories are
generally too long for Sunday-school teaching, and
the danger is that they will overshadow the truth.
Illustrative teaching should be employed in the Sabbath-school
to make divine truth glow and become
plainer, clearer, and better understood&mdash;nothing else.
It must never displace the lesson, but be held in strict
subordination to it. Illustrations of divine truths
are very useful&mdash;in fact, indispensable; but dangerous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
unless well guarded so as never to withdraw
attention from the Bible.</p>

<p>This was one of our divine Saviour's chosen
modes of teaching, as we see in the beautiful parable
of the sower, and, in fact, in almost all of His inimitable
parables. Mankind, as well as children, delight
in this form of instruction. Says Mr. Groser, in his
excellent work on this subject: "Children have a
passion for details and revel in analogies. Mark
their fondness for <i>stories</i>, however frivolous; <i>word-pictures</i>,
however meagre, and <i>comparisons</i>, however
commonplace." Tupper says:</p>

<div class="small">

 <p class="indent2">"Principles and rules are repulsive to a child, but happy illustration
 winneth him.</p>

 <p class="indent2">In vain shalt thou preach of industry and prudence till he learn of
 the bee and ant.</p>

 <p class="indent2">Dimly will he think of his soul, till the acorn and the chrysalis
 have taught him.</p>

 <p class="indent2">He will fear God in thunder and worship His loveliness in flowers.</p>

 <p class="indent2">And parables shall charm his heart, while doctrines seem dead
 mystery."</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent">Illustration is something laid alongside of&mdash;parallel&mdash;for
comparison, and should be short, obvious, and
appropriate. There must always be something to
illustrate.</p>

<p>For instance: If we were teaching, "Take us the
foxes, the little foxes," etc., we could illustrate the danger
and influence of little evils or sins by saying:
Chemists tell us that a single grain of iodine will color
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
7000 times its weight in water; so a little sin may
discolor and destroy a good character. A ruined man
once said: "It was that ten minutes on the street-corner,
reading a bad book, that destroyed my
whole life." "It was that penny I stole when a
very young boy," said an old man, "that sent me
four times to prison, and confined me twenty-eight
years out of sixty of my life, and all for stealing less
than thirty-eight dollars."</p>

<p>Or if the lesson was, "No man can serve two
masters," etc., let the teacher say: "The other day
I saw two men together walking down the avenue,
and a little dog was running behind them; so they
went on for a while, and I wondered to which of
them the dog belonged. When they came to the
corner of a certain street they shook hands and went
opposite ways. Then I saw at once to which of
them the little dog belonged. He could not follow
both; so he trotted after his master. So, dear children,
it is with you; you may try to be Christ's servants
and the servants of Satan at the same time, but
it will be in vain; 'You cannot serve God and
mammon.'"</p>

<p>If on the subject of falsehood, we would impress
our pupils with the fact that the degree does not
affect criminality. An apt illustration will be found
in "Eve and the forbidden fruit."</p>

<p>The Bible is full of perfect examples, if rightly
selected. "Old Humphrey," the English writer for
children, abounded in pertinent illustrations. I copy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
one: "Think not that because you look like other
teachers or scholars, and undertake the same duties,
that no difference is seen by those around you. You
may look alike and be altogether different."</p>

<p>Illustration 1. "I came to two frozen ponds, so
much alike in size and form that at the first view one
might have been regarded as the counterpart of the
other. This was, however, very far from being the
case; for, after making a hole in the ice, I found one
to be only a few inches deep, while with my stick I
could not reach the bottom of the other."</p>

<p>2. "I picked up two walnuts as they lay among
the dry leaves, under the tree on which they had
grown; both were large, and I thought that each
would be good; but, no! one was altogether hollow,
while the other contained a capital kernel."</p>

<p>3. "I bought two apples at a fruit-stand&mdash;ruddy
and ripe; I do not believe the man who sold them to
me could have pointed out any difference between
them; and yet, for all this, when I came to turn them
around and examine them, I found one of them to
be firm and sound, and the other rotten to the very
core."</p>

<p>"As it was with the ponds, the walnuts, and the
apples, so it may be with you. Some are shallow,
while others have depth of understanding; some
have depth of understanding, while others are shallow;
some are full of knowledge, while others are
empty; and some are firm and to be relied upon,
while others are unsound at their hearts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
These are short and very simple, but excellent and
to the point.</p>

<p>The Bible is full of perfect examples of illustrative
teaching. The parables are mostly of this order.
The parable of the sower, with the field and husbandman
before him, as is probable, is a striking example
of illustrative teaching. In the gospels, how
constantly our Saviour began His parables with,
"The kingdom of heaven is <i>likened</i> unto," or is
"<i>like</i>," etc. Said an old divine to a young preacher:
"I see you do not follow Christ's example in your
preaching; for you have no '<i>likes</i>' in your sermons."
Do we <i>liken</i> Bible truth to something with
which our scholars are familiar, and thus help them
to understand it?</p>

<p>Illustrations abound all around us. Some years
ago there was published a work entitled "Spiritual
Honey from Natural Hives." I do not know but
it is now out of print; but it contained no less than
258 illustrations of various passages of Scripture&mdash;all
drawn from the honey-bee, and most of them
were valuable. For example: "Mercy comes naturally
from God, like honey from the bee; but justice,
like the sting, only when she is provoked." "If
nature teaches the bee not only to gather honey out
of sweet flowers, but out of bitter, shall not grace
teach us to draw, even out of the bitterest condition,
something to better our souls?" "Many hate not
sin, nor fly from it, because it is <i>sin</i>; but as children
do bees; not because they are bees, but because they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
have a <i>sting</i>. So do these persons flee from sin; not
because it is <i>sinful</i>, but because it is <i>hurtful</i>."</p>

<p>The following convey important lessons to Bible-students:
"If you do but take and pierce God's
word, and do but stay upon it, as the bee doth on
the flower, and <i>will not off</i> till you have got something
out of it; if you still be digging in this mine,
this will make you rich in knowledge; and if you
be rich in knowledge, it will make you rich in
grace." Finally: "Some use flowers only for the
beauty or the smell; the physicians, for health; the
bees, for honey; so do wise and prudent persons apply
their studies for the enriching and feeding of
their minds."</p>

<p>The late eloquent Rev. Dr. Payson was accustomed
to illustrate under the form of apt <i>suppositions</i>.
For instance, said he: "Suppose you wished
to separate a quantity of brass and steel filings mixed
together in one vessel; how would you effect this
separation? Apply a loadstone, and immediately
every particle of iron will attach itself to it, while
the brass filings remain behind. Thus, if we see a
company of true and false professors of religion, we
may not be able to distinguish them; but let Christ
come among them, and all His sincere followers will
be attracted towards Him, as the steel is drawn to
the magnet, while those who have none of His spirit
will remain at a distance." Again: On a visit to a
weeping mother, who refused to be comforted for the
loss of a beloved child: "Suppose, now," said he,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
"some one was making a beautiful crown for you to
wear, and that you knew it was for you, and that
you were to receive it and wear it as soon as it should
be done; now, if the maker of it were to come, and
in order to make the crown more beautiful and splendid,
were to take some of your jewels to put into it,
should you be sorrowful and unhappy because they
were taken away for a little while, when you knew
they were going to make up your crown? He can
take better care of them than you could." The
mother smiled through her tears at the thought that
her jewel was taken from her but for a season, and
said, in meek submission: "The Lord gave, and the
Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the
Lord."</p>

<p>The question here arises, From whence shall Sunday-school
teachers gather illustrations for use? I
reply, generally, everywhere, and from everything;
but to particularize: 1. From the home-surroundings,
circumstances, and home-life of the pupils. 2. Facts
and incidents that are constantly occurring around
us. "<i>Facts</i> are the arguments of God," said Rev.
Dr. Chalmers. 3. History, biography, and geography&mdash;sacred
and profane. 4. Agriculture, horticulture,
and botany. 5. Proverbs, maxims, wise sayings,
and poetry. 6. Emblems, similes, metaphors,
etc. 7. Science and art; manners and customs.</p>

<p>I need not extend this list, for these will readily
suggest many others to the teacher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h2>XII.<br />
PICTORIAL TEACHING.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capP-094.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PICTORIAL teaching is only a slightly different
form of Bible illustration, and, therefore,
will appropriately follow the previous
subject.</p>

<p>It presents, first, pictures and maps to the pupils
for examination, in order that they may get a clearer
view of truth. It consists, secondly, more particularly
in picturing out in words, or in vivid, graphic
description, so that the truth will appear real to the
imagination of the child. It awakens interest and
deepens impression, and all good teachers avail
themselves, more or less, of its power.</p>

<p>"But," says a quiet teacher, "all this must be
graphically done." I reply: "Of course it must;"
and the answer returns: "Well, I can't use it,
then, for I am not graphic." I will give all such
teachers a recipe that will render them always
graphic with children. If they would dwell clearly
and plainly on all the little details in their descriptions
to children, they will always be graphic. The
imaginations of scholars of ten or twelve years of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
age are so vivid that much of the teacher's power
over them, to interest and impress truth, will depend
largely upon this power of "word-picturing."
Words containing objects largely should be most
used, instead of a mass of sentiments and principles.
Let the objective words preponderate.</p>

<p>The following statement embraces about a dozen
words in <i>principles</i>:</p>

 <p class="small">"It was David's <i>duty</i> to <i>know</i> the <i>will</i> of God,
 and as he had great <i>faith</i> in the divine <i>power</i>, he went
 forth without <i>reluctance</i> to meet the <i>foe</i>, and the
 <i>result</i> was the death of Goliath."</p>

<p>Let us now transpose the sentence into <i>objects</i>
mainly, and it will not be difficult to see which will
make the clearest and best impression upon children's
minds:</p>

 <p class="small">"Young David <i>stood</i> in the <i>valley</i> and slung a
 <i>stone</i> into the <i>forehead</i> of the <i>giant</i>, Goliath,
 and he <i>fell</i> dead upon the ground."</p>

<p>Abbott gives many illustrations. He says:</p>

 <p class="small">"You tell a man, 'He went down to the shore, and got into a boat and
 pushed off.' You would interest a child more if you say, 'He went
 down to the shore and found a boat there. One end of the boat&mdash;the
 front part, which they call the bow&mdash;was up against the shore, a
 little in the sand. The other end was out of the water, and moved up
 and down gently with the waves. There were seats across the boat, and
 two oars tying upon the seats. The man stepped upon the bow of the
 boat; it was fast in the mud.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
 And so on, describing the water under one end, and sand under the
 other; the one end rocking and rattling the oars, and the man walking
 back and pushing the boat off," etc.</p>

<p>Be exceedingly minute, therefore, with little children.
In all the details which you describe take
very short steps, and take each one distinctly. The
Bible narratives are wonderfully adapted to good pictorial
teaching. Bible emblems, which so abound,
must be carefully pictured out; as, "The Lord God
is a sun and shield," a "rock," and "refuge." "As
the hart panteth," etc. Detail it so as to make the
scene as real as possible to the child, and enable him
to see the hart, the mountain, the water brooks, etc.
Suppose you were on the lesson of the apprehension
and trial of Christ:</p>

 <p class="small">"Children, see that crowd of people wending their way through the
 streets of Jerusalem! Some of them carry torches or lanterns in their
 hands; others have staves or swords. See, in the midst of them there
 walks one who looks very kind, but very sorrowful. Who is it? It is
 Jesus. The multitude, led on by the cruel priests, have just been to
 the garden of Gethsemane and hurried him away from His disciples; and
 now they are going to take Him before their rulers, that they may
 have Him put to death. Then describe the High Priest, Pilate, and
 Herod; the judgment hall, the drops of blood, the soldiers, and crown
 of thorns; the cross, the angry cries of, 'Crucify Him!'"</p>

<p>All this must be done with care and exactness, and
before adopting it the teacher must make himself
<i>very familiar</i> with every part, so as never to hesitate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
or labor in it; and then afterward call it all back by
questions, in the children's own language.</p>

<p>Again: Suppose you wished to make a lasting impression
on a child while developing a single important
thought; as, for instance, the omniscience of
God. Talk candidly to the child somewhat as follows:</p>

 <p class="small">"Mary, do you know that God knows all things? He saw Adam and Eve
 when they hid themselves in the trees of the garden. He saw Moses
 when he lay in his little ark by the side of the river. He saw
 Timothy when his mother taught him to read the Bible. He sees every
 person in the world just now. You know in Africa there are a great
 many millions of men and women. They are black. They are called
 negroes. God sees them all, and he sees the missionaries who are
 there teaching them God's word; and at the very some moment he sees
 all the people of this country, and every person in this town. He
 sees you, Mary. He saw you when you were a little babe in your
 cradle; he sees you at all your plays, and in the school; he knows
 what you say, and what you think; he sees every tear that falls from
 your eye, and every smile that plays on your cheek; he hears you sing
 his praises; and when you pray, Mary, God listens to everything that
 you ask; and when you lie down, and the room is dark and still, and
 there is nothing moving but your pulse, and nothing heard but your
 breathing, then God sees you, for the darkness and the light are both
 alike to Him."</p>

<p>Thus dwell <i>amply</i> on a thought until you associate
it in the child's mind with many circumstances. For
Bible-classes, of course, a teacher would not descend
to all the details of some of these examples, yet in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
every age and class be graphic and life-like in word-picturing.
The parables of the prodigal son, and of
the good Samaritan, are divinely beautiful examples
of pictorial teaching, for when our Saviour wanted
to impress love to our neighbor he <i>pictured</i> out for
us the beautiful story of the good Samaritan.</p>

<p>The following example is from "David Stow's
Bible-training," published in Edinburgh, and is the
"Training System" pictured out in words:</p>

<div class="small">

 <h3><i>Example.</i></h3>

 <p>"As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after
 thee, O God." Ps. xlii.&nbsp;1. The more common way that the pious teacher
 or parent takes, is to pass over the emblem, and at once proceed with
 the spiritual lesson&mdash;<i>thus beginning at the end</i>&mdash;without any
 natural picture having been presented to the mind's eye of the
 pupils, by which they maybe assisted to the analogy&mdash;<i>as</i> and
 <i>so</i>, as the Natural, so the Spiritual&mdash;which is so uniformly
 done by the Spirit of God in Scripture.</p>

 <p class="center"><i>Points in the Natural Picture to be brought out.</i></p>

 <p>1. Some points in the natural history of the hart&mdash;different names
 given to the animal&mdash;swiftness of foot&mdash;where generally lives. 2.
 Frequently hunted. 3. Where to flee to in a mountainous country, as
 Judea, when pursued&mdash;hills or valleys. 4. Heat, drought, dust&mdash;effect
 on the animal, particularly after running&mdash;thirst. 5. Running about
 seeking for water&mdash;increasing&mdash;not merely a drink, but a brook, where
 it may plunge in as well as drink. 6. Why, then, a brook, and not
 stream?&mdash;picture out a brook. 7. Brooks more likely to be found in
 plains&mdash;but animal pursued there. 8. The hart, heated and thirsty,
 therefore <i>pants</i>&mdash;what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
 is panting? 9. Has the hart ever bathed in water brooks before? If
 not, would it have panted and longed for it? The full picturing out
 of these points (even in the incomplete and imperfect manner that can
 be done on paper) would greatly exceed our limits. The natural
 picture or condition of the hart being visible to the minds of the
 children, the analogy to the circumstances in which David was placed
 will appear, viz., pursued by his enemies, and especially by his own
 son, Absalom&mdash;fleeing to the mountains for safety&mdash;away from the
 sanctuary, etc., etc. He, no doubt, on seeing the harts near him
 panting and seeking for water brooks, mournfully and longingly
 expressed himself: "So panteth my soul after thee, O God."</p>

 <p><i>Teacher.</i>&mdash;I must tell you, children, before we commence our
 lesson, that it is supposed this psalm was written by David, who was
 obliged to flee from his enemies to the land of Jordan, and that when
 there he probably took up his abode in the mountains, away from the
 public worship of ... <i>God's house</i>, and seeing the harts
 running ... Where? <i>about the hills</i>, and panting for thirst,
 most likely induced him to use the ... What metaphor or emblem did he
 use? Look at your books. David says: "As the hart panteth after the
 ... <i>water-brooks</i> (read on, children), <i>so panteth my soul
 after thee, O God</i>."</p>

 <p>The first thing we must speak about in this picture is the ...
 <i>hart</i>. What is a hart? Can you tell me any other names given to
 the hart? <i>Stag</i>&mdash;<i>deer</i>&mdash;<i>gazelle</i>&mdash;<i>roe</i>. Very
 right; these are the names given to ... <i>this animal</i>, or ...
 <i>species</i>.</p>

 <p>Well, the name of this animal or ... <i>species</i>, is called ...
 the <i>hart</i>. Is it a slow or quick moving animal? <i>Swift</i>.
 It runs ... <i>very swiftly</i>. What countries do harts chiefly live
 in? <i>Mountainous countries.</i> Why do you think so? <i>The Bible
 says, "Like a young roe upon the mountains.</i>" And a young roe is
 ... <i>a young hart</i>. Well, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
 is one proof that they live in the mountains; but can they live in
 the plains? <i>Yes, sir; they live in plains in gentlemen's
 parks</i>, which are sometimes ... <i>plain</i>, or nearly ...
 <i>level</i>. Very well; but when allowed to roam and run about
 freely and ... <i>naturally</i>, they ... <i>prefer the
 mountains</i>. Is the hart spoken of in the psalm supposed to live in
 a warm or cold country, think you? <i>A warm country.</i> Why? ...
 Bring down the map, children, and show the country or countries you
 suppose to be meant. (The map of Palestine is presented.) Point out
 those parts you think harts live in. You think the Psalmist means ...
 <i>the mountainous parts of Palestine</i>. And Palestine is ... What
 sort of a country? <i>Mountainous country</i>, and ... <i>very
 hot</i>. Now, we must get smartly on. The hart lives in ... <i>a hot
 country</i>, and in the mountainous parts of ... <i>a hot
 country</i>. How does the sun shine? <i>Over head, nearly
 perpendicular</i>, and, therefore, the great part of the year the
 ground must be ... <i>very hot and dry</i>. In what state will the
 soil be? <i>Parched and dusty.</i> And in mountainous countries,
 where the sun is very hot, what happens to the streams or brooks?
 <i>The brooks dry up.</i> It is then a dry and ... <i>thirsty
 land</i>, and where ... <i>no water is</i>. If you turn in your Bible
 to Job vi.&nbsp;15, it is said: "And as the stream of brooks they pass
 away,"&mdash;showing that the brooks in that hot climate are ... <i>very
 apt to pass away</i>, or ... <i>dry up</i>.</p>

 <p>Tell me, children, what you mean by panting? Show me what panting is?
 This boy thinks it is simply opening the mouth. (Take nothing for
 granted.) Have you ever seen a dog walking in a very hot and dusty
 day, after having run a long way? <i>Yes, sir; it opens its
 mouth.</i> Does it simply open its mouth, as this boy did? <i>It
 pants, this way. It feels uneasy.</i> Why uneasy? Because <i>it is
 weary and thirsty</i>. Weary and thirsty from ... <i>the heat</i>;
 and a thirsty dog, that is weary and very ... <i>hot</i>, would&mdash;what
 would it wish? <i>To have a drink</i>, or, perhaps, to ... <i>plunge
 in the brook</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
 Of what had the hart drank before? <i>The brooks.</i> Well, the hart
 having both drank of ... <i>the brook</i>, and ... <i>plunged in the
 brook before</i>, longed and ... <i>panted to do so again</i>. In
 this sad condition, therefore&mdash;heated and ... <i>thirsty</i>, and
 running about, ... <i>panting</i>&mdash;how would the hart feel? Would he
 be satisfied to lie down? <i>No, sir; very anxious.</i> And what
 more? <i>Longing and panting for water.</i> Not at rest, because it
 ... <i>felt</i>&mdash;the ... <i>want of something</i> it could not get at
 ... <i>that time</i>; and that was ... <i>the water brooks</i>.</p>

 <p>Now, let us look at the verse, and see in what state or ...
 <i>condition</i> the hart is supposed to be. Repeat it, if you
 please, each word, separately, slowly, and distinctly. "As, the,
 hart, panteth, after, the, water, brooks." What is a brook? <i>A
 clear stream</i>&mdash;not a muddy, stagnant ... <i>pool</i>. Do you think
 the hart had drank of a brook before? <i>Yes; else it would not have
 panted for it.</i> What makes the hart so very thirsty? <i>Because it
 runs about the hills, where there is no water.</i> And as the hart
 opens ... <i>its mouth</i>, and ... <i>pants for water</i>, and runs
 about, it raises the ... What do you think it raises? <i>The dust
 into its mouth.</i> And what does the dust do? <i>Increases its
 thirst</i>, and causes the hart to long more for ... <i>the
 brooks</i>&mdash;which are now ... <i>dried up</i>&mdash;or, perhaps, at a ...
 <i>great distance</i>. What would you expect the hart to do were it
 to reach a brook? <i>Drink plentifully</i>&mdash;and, also, ... <i>plunge
 into the water</i>. Why? <i>To cool</i> and ... <i>refresh
 itself</i>. The application, or spiritual lesson, is by recalling the
 <i>hart</i>, on the <i>mountains</i>, <i>hunted by dogs</i>, <i>shot
 at by arrows</i>, <i>hot and thirsty</i>, <i>panting</i> for <i>water
 brooks</i>, for a <i>plunge-bath</i>, and <i>drink</i>. So, David
 fleeing on the mountains for life, pursued by enemies, <i>longing</i>
 for safety, and for the public worship of God at Jerusalem,
 <i>panting</i> for the Lord's house, where <i>God's law</i> was read,
 and the true God was worshipped, etc. He <i>desired, longed</i> for,
 <i>panted</i>, <i>prayed</i> for God, the living God.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
 Children, do <i>you so long for</i>, and <i>pant after</i> God, the
 living God? etc., etc.</p>

</div>

<p>Another form of pictorial teaching is, after questioning
the lesson out of the scholars, and then in
again, and explaining all the words, etc., to paint
imaginary pictures of the events described in the
lesson. Thus, in a lesson from Matt. xiv.&nbsp;22-33,
taught by the Rev. Edward Eggleston, of Chicago,
he said to the first pupil: "Carrie, suppose that you
were a painter with your canvas before you, what
picture would you draw from the 22d verse?" She
replied, "Christ sending his disciples and the multitudes
away." "Mary, what from the 23d verse?"
"Christ on the mountain, alone, in prayer." "Jane,
what from the 24th verse?" "The ship tossed with
the waves." "Lily, what from verse 25?" "Jesus
walking on the sea." The next, "Peter sinking,
Jesus saving;" and then, "The sea calm, all safe in
the ship, worshipping Jesus." From these the lessons
drawn are "Secret prayer," "Looking to Jesus
for help in danger," "Not seeking danger," and that
"Jesus is God," to control the wind and waves. The
doctrine is the Divinity of Christ: "Of a truth, thou
art the Son of God."</p>

<p>"Pictorial Teaching," by Hartley and Groser, on
Illustrative Teaching, further illustrates these subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<h2>XIII.<br />
OBJECT-TEACHING.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS is presenting an object to look at, for
the purpose of getting a clearer and more
perfect view of the truth taught. It is simply
calling to our aid the <i>eye</i>. The eye is one of our
two great learning senses. It has been called "the
king of the senses," and it is emphatically so with
children; for little children learn the most that they
do learn through the eye. Bunyan quaintly says:
"Come to the mind and soul through Eye-gate as
well as through Ear-gate." This is the most pleasant
and effective way of giving and receiving some kinds
of knowledge. It cultivates, also, the important
habit of close and accurate observation. Says the
Rev. Dr. Hill, the President of Harvard University:
"It is the thought of God in the object that stimulates
the child's thought." The great object is to
teach the child more than you can express in words.
In illustration, he says: "I was walking yesterday
with my little girl, and showing her plants, insects,
and birds as we walked along. We were looking at
lichens on the trees, when she suddenly, and without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
hint from me, said: 'The maples have different
lichens from the ash. I mean to see if I can tell
trees by their trunks, without looking at their leaves.'
So for a long distance she kept her eyes down, saying
to the trees as she passed: Elm, maple, ash,
pine,' etc&mdash;never failing. The difference was easy
to <i>see</i>, but the difference could not have been so well
expressed in <i>words</i>."</p>

<p>Our schools of public instruction are largely using
this mode of teaching in the early years of school-life,
with great gratification to the children, and, also,
with great success. The size, form, shape, color,
origin, and uses of many articles are thus taught,
incidentally weaving in spelling, reading, and a vast
amount of useful knowledge. If this were all, however,
it would hardly avail much in our Sabbath-schools
above the infant class. But we apprehend
that in some particular Sabbath-school lessons, but
not in all, object-teaching can be used to great advantage
by all classes and conditions of scholars.
Never force or crowd object-teaching, however, upon
any lesson.</p>

<p>The simple difference between object-teaching and
illustrative teaching is this: If you were teaching on
the words "Though your sins be red like crimson,
they shall be as wool," in <i>illustrative</i> teaching,
we should tell the children that the Turkey-red
dyes are so firm that no bleacher's salts will make
them white, and therefore, we make the Turkey-red
rags into pink blotting-paper; in <i>object</i>-teaching,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
we hold up the Turkey-red calico, explain it, and
then <i>show</i> the pink blotting-paper&mdash;making it, by
help of the two objects and the explanation, more
impressive with children. In fact, there are lessons
that cannot be plainly taught without the use of objects.
They need, however, to be used with discretion;
and upon Bible lessons only on those that will
make the truths <i>better</i> understood.</p>

<p>We have, however, the highest authority for the
use of objects in teaching religious truths. Our
Saviour himself practised this mode of teaching. It
will be remembered that when the crafty Scribes
and Pharisees sought to entangle him in his talk,
and proposed the question&mdash;"Master, is it lawful to
give tribute unto Cæsar or not?" he, perceiving
their wickedness, said, "Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?
Show me the tribute-money. And they
brought unto Him a penny." Why did the divine
Redeemer, who never did a superfluous thing, or
spoke a superfluous word,&mdash;why did He, who is infinite
in wisdom, call for this penny? We may
safely reply, Because it was divinely <i>best</i> and needful.
He wanted to bring to bear the two great learning
senses, to wit, <i>seeing</i> and <i>hearing</i>. He then
directed the eyes of these scheming men to the coin,
with this pointed question: "Whose is this image
and superscription? They said unto him, Cæsar's."
Then came the inimitable <i>application</i> of the lesson&mdash;without
which every lesson is a failure&mdash;viz.:
"Render therefore unto Cæsar the things which be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Cæsar's, and unto God the things which be God's."
We are told that "when they had heard these words,
they marvelled, and left him, and went their way."
The lesson was conclusive.</p>

<p>At another time, you remember that our Saviour
"called a little child unto him and set him in the midst
of them," to teach his disciples the answer to their
query, "Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
Here the little child was the object. The lesson
is obvious to all. Even in the memorial service of
our Saviour's death, he called for two <i>objects</i>&mdash;the
bread and the wine. It was divinely necessary.</p>

<p>We may seem almost to see the same divine
Teacher bending forward and pointing his disciples
to the beautiful flowers at his feet, exclaiming:
"Behold the lilies of the field," or look at the "fowls
of the air," or see "the fields white unto the harvest,"
or the falling sparrow, or the fig-tree, and a
multitude of similar objects all around them, which
were used by him in his wonderful teaching, and
with such success that they were led to exclaim:
"Never man spake like this man." The whole of
the types and ceremonies in the Old Testament were
but a magnificent series of this mode of object-teaching.
This is the whole, in substance, of object-teaching.
It is Christ's mode and the prophet's way
of teaching. "It is nature's teaching," says a teacher
at our side. There is <i>no</i> teaching, scarcely, that is
not, in some sense, object-teaching. Said the Rev.
Dr. Chester, when describing good teaching: "This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
is object-teaching, as all good teaching of the young
is. You must take their measure if you would fit
the garment of truth to them." Objects for teaching
lie all over nature as clearly as in cubes and squares
and octagons. It keeps each child pleasantly and
profitably employed. It is calling the eye and senses
to our aid in affecting the mind and heart. The eye
is our first teacher. Hence it is indispensably necessary
in an infant class to have plenty of objects.
Every good mother and good juvenile class-teacher
will make great use of the <i>eye</i> and <i>action</i> and <i>motion</i>
to teach and impress the great truths of the lesson
upon the little ones. Use the eye more, and
make your words few and well chosen. "Present to
the children <i>things</i> before <i>words</i>, or <i>ideas</i> before
<i>names</i>." Even in manners and morals let the <i>person,
life</i> and <i>tongue</i> of the teacher be the "object."
"She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her
tongue is the law of kindness."</p>

<p>Here is an art that every teacher should become
facile in, <i>i. e.</i>, looking up and using objects that will
serve our purpose in teaching; and for this reason,
he should always wear his "Sunday-school spectacles."
A sprig of evergreen, or a bit of a vine
picked from the bush as we pass our garden-gate for
the Sunday-school, may serve to illustrate the duty
of "abiding in Christ" as the branch must abide in
the vine. A little flower or grass, or a falling leaf,
will illustrate, through the eye, the brevity of life,
and that "we all do fade as a leaf." Even a pin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
may be used as an object, from whence to draw lessons
as to the value, use, and importance of <i>little
things</i>. When the pin is crooked and rendered useless,
we can with it rebuke crooked tempers or
crooked tongues or characters.</p>

<p>A child may be led to see "the whole armor of
God" in a picture of an old knight with his "helmet,"
"shield," "breastplate," and "sword." A
plaster cast of a <i>faithful</i> dog, loving doves, little
Samuel in prayer, or David with his shepherd's staff,
have all been frequently used to teach divine lessons.
A specimen of good fruit will teach us to bring forth
good fruit&mdash;to be fruit-bearers; and the showing of a
watch may be made the means of much valuable
instruction to children.</p>

<p>But we must sum up some of the leading things
which may be used in Sunday-school object-teaching,
viz.:</p>

<div class="list">
<ol>

 <li>Natural objects.</li>
 <li>Texts, cards, etc.</li>
 <li>Maps, charts, etc.</li>
 <li>Pictures and drawings.</li>
 <li>Word-painting, or pictorial teaching by aid of the imagination.</li>
 <li>Parables, parallels, etc.</li>
 <li>Portable slates and paper.</li>
 <li>The blackboard, which furnishes ample facilities for object-teaching.</li>

<h3><span class="smcap">Object Lessons in Brief Notes.</span><br />
<i>Examples.</i></h3>

<p>The following is an outline lesson on a picture-print of</p>

<div class="small">

<h4><i>David and Goliath.</i> 1&nbsp;Sam. xvii.</h4>

 <p>Ps. xviii.&nbsp;32: Success is from the Lord.</p>

 <p><i>First.</i> Remarks and questions on the print. Ask the children to
 point out the two principal figures&mdash;to tell you what difference they
 observe in them; one is an immense man&mdash;a giant; the other a young
 lad. The difference in their dress&mdash;one is clad in armor, with
 helmet, shield, and spear; the other has a light dress, with a crook,
 a sling, and a bag. Let them describe the manner and action of each.
 The giant looks fierce and angry, raising his spear and clenching his
 enormous fist. The lad appears calm and gentle; casting his look
 upwards, he points to heaven. For what purpose do they seem to be
 met? How can the youth escape so great and powerful an enemy? Where
 can he look for help? Ask the children what they would do under the
 circumstances.</p>

 <p><i>Secondly.</i> The narrative. Give the children an account from the
 Bible of Goliath's size and his armor, and let them see how complete
 the latter was. Read to them how he defied the armies of the living
 God, and challenged any to combat with him. Who is able to stand
 against so mighty an enemy? All the Israelite soldiers are afraid. At
 last a slender youth comes forward and offers himself. How is he
 prepared for the contest? What makes him so bold? Read verses 32-37.
 He trusts in the Lord. It is His cause in which he fights. This is
 David. See how he prepares himself (verse 40). His spirit is shown in
 verses 45, 46.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
 Success was with David (see 48-50). Contrast the appearance of the
 two, their different preparation and their spirit.</p>

 <p><i>Lesson.</i> David fought in the name of the Lord, trusted in His
 strength, and sought His glory. How can we imitate him? All sin, all
 evil, is the enemy of the Lord: we must fight against them in His
 strength and seeking His glory, and He will make us more than
 conquerors.</p>

 <h4><i>Different Objects.</i></h4>

 <p>1. 1. Object, <i>a Leaf</i>. Children, what do I hold in my hand?
 <i>A leaf.</i> What can you tell an about it? One says it has
 <i>form</i>; others, <i>color</i>, <i>substance</i>, <i>length</i>,
 <i>breadth</i>, <i>thickness</i>, <i>branches</i> in its frame like
 the tree, all <i>different</i>, etc., etc. What is a leaf? <i>The
 clothing of trees.</i> Gen. viii.&nbsp;11.</p>

 <p>2. What does the Bible say about a leaf or leaves? Shall not wither,
 Ps. i.&nbsp;3&mdash;be green, Jer. xvii.&nbsp;8&mdash;not fade, Ezek. xlvii.&nbsp;12&mdash;fadeth,
 Is. i.&nbsp;30&mdash;sewed fig-leaves, Gen. iii.&nbsp;7&mdash;cast their leaves, Is.
 vi.&nbsp;13&mdash;fair, Dan. iv.&nbsp;12, 21&mdash;nothing but leaves, Mark
 xi.&nbsp;13&mdash;putteth forth leaves, Mark xiii.&nbsp;28. Enlarge and illustrate
 any points.</p>

 <p>3. See Rev. xxii.&nbsp;2: And the <i>leaves</i> of the tree were for the
 healing of the nations.</p>

 <p>See <i>bad</i>, <i>poisonous leaves</i>. Upas tree, poison-ivy, etc.</p>

 <p>See <i>good leaves</i>.&mdash;Sassafras, balsam, wintergreen, etc.</p>

 <p>The <i>leaves of the Bible</i> are for the healing of the nations,
 etc.</p>

 <p>Corrupt <i>leaves</i> or bad books blight and destroy.</p>

 <p>II. Object, <i>a Grapevine with cluster of fruit</i>. <i>Cut</i>
 branch will not <i>unite</i> again with the vine. <i>Prune</i> so as
 to produce fruit, otherwise will run to leaves. Taste of good fruit.
 See fruits of the Spirit, Gal. v.&nbsp;22, love, joy, peace, etc. How bear
 such, etc.</p>

 <p>III. Object, <i>a Pin</i>. Sharp, straight, and shining. How many for
 a penny? Thirty persons to make it. So little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
 and cheap, not valued. So of common blessings&mdash;air, light, water.
 Feel your pulse. Not live without it. <i>So learn to value little
 things.</i></p>

 <p>See its value in need, as in storms, cold, etc. So value Bible,
 health, school, church, etc., while you have them.</p>

 <p>Bend it, and it becomes <i>crooked</i>,&mdash;so crooked <i>tempers</i>,
 <i>tongues</i>, etc.</p>

 <p>IV. A <i>Sprig of Evergreen</i>, broken off, may teach us to
 <i>abide</i> in Christ.</p>

 <p>V. <i>Salt</i>, as a grand <i>preservative</i>. A <i>Rotten
 Apple</i>, influence and decay.</p>

 <p>VI. <i>Flowers</i>, so beautiful and frail. A pansy may teach
 <i>humility</i>, a daisy, <i>cheerfulness</i>, a rose, <i>goodness
 and virtue</i>, a lily, <i>purity</i>, etc.</p>

THE BLACKBOARD.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capW-053.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE would not undertake to conduct a Sabbath-school
without a good blackboard. The great object of it is to direct, to concentrate,
and to <i>fix</i> the attention, sympathies, and prayers
of the whole school upon that portion of the word
of God which is embodied in the great practical
thought of the lesson. It is affectingly interesting to
see a whole school, teachers and scholars, banishing
their worldly thoughts, and raising their eyes and
hearts apparently up to the great warm thought of
God, as they cross the threshold of the school-room,
and see, in clear, distinct letters on the blackboard,
the key-note of the lesson for the day; as, "My son,
give me thy heart." "Son, go work to-day in my
vineyard." "The soul that sinneth, it shall die."
"I will arise and go to my father." "Have faith in
God." "All waiting for Jesus." "Flee from the
wrath to come." "About my Father's business."
"The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from
all sin." "Founded on a rock," etc.</p>

<p>Blackboards have long been used in public schools
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
with great advantage, but have only been adopted in
Sunday-schools during the last decade of years.
They, however, prove to be so well adapted and
useful that they are meeting with universal approval,
and are fast coming into general use. We think a
blackboard should be used in every Sabbath-school,
on every Sabbath, by every superintendent, and on
every lesson; for the dullest superintendent, in city
or country, can plainly write or print one thought
from the word of God on the blackboard, and thus
fix the eye and concentrate the thought and heart of
the otherwise careless, upon the lesson.</p>

<p>We have often seen the noisiest boys of the city
calmed by this means into thoughtfulness and interest
in the lesson. Sometimes colored crayons are used
to attract as well as to impress. The names of the
Deity are sometimes carefully written in crayon of
one color, while wrath, sin, etc., may be put in
another color, say <i>red</i>.</p>

<p>A map, drawn by the superintendent or pastor on
the blackboard in the presence of the school, will have
many times the effect that it will have, if we point to
a regular map. A cross of two rough marks made by
a teacher on a slip of paper, to illustrate the lesson,
will interest a child more than will a jewelled cross,&mdash;it
was made by teacher.</p>

<p>Frequently the superintendent or teacher will
write down the answer, or the main word of the
<i>answers</i> of the children on the blackboard, and this
will interest them greatly. A teacher can use a piece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of white paper to write or draw on for the scholars
of a private class. A few points must be heeded&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Do not put any but well-digested, important
words, thoughts, and objects on the blackboard.</p>

<p>2. Write or draw as plainly, neatly, and correctly
as possible. Do not write too much.</p>

<p>3. Let all the exercises of the school bear directly
towards the one great thought of the lesson.</p>

<p>Thus let the freshest and most prominent object
in the school-room aid the teacher and superintendent,
through the use of the eye, in their great
work.</p>

<p>A word of caution is needed, however, concerning
the use of the blackboard. Sometimes it has been
made to appear quite ridiculous by a fanciful and
perverted use of it. The only justifiable use of the
blackboard in a Sabbath-school is in order to make
Bible truths more clear and attractive in the eyes of
teachers and scholars. Men of good taste, as well
as those having tact and ingenuity, can and do use
the blackboard with power in various ways. For
instance, some years ago I saw a lesson taught in
Ralph Wells's school&mdash;and many of my examples
originated with him&mdash;from the text in Matt. v.&nbsp;16: "Let
your light so shine," etc. This was plainly
written on the board, while on one side was drawn
a figure of a light-house, with the rays of light shining
forth from the lamp. The superintendent in a
review pressed the question, "<i>How</i> are we to let
our light shine, according to the lesson, 'So shine?'"&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
very soon the children said they were to let their
light shine by "being pure," "meek," "merciful,"
etc., and soon the beatitudes were each written on
the separate rays from the light-house lamp.</p>

<p>At another time I noticed the text, "Founded on
a rock," together with the figure of a house firm on
a rock, and another house crumbling and falling
down "on the sand." See to the foundation.</p>

<p>A catechism lesson on the question, "What is
sin?" was placed on the board "<i>My sin.</i>"</p>

<div class="small">

 <h3><i>Examples of Blackboard Exercises.</i></h3>

 <p>The following examples are given as suggestive of several different
 lines of use to which the blackboard may be put:</p>

 <p class="gap-above">The substance of a lesson in the 6th chapter of Matthew was once put
 upon the board in two words, "Outside" and "Inside," the children
 being asked to examine the chapter and tell what to write on the
 blackboard; at the end of the address the board appeared as follows,
 each specification having been vividly illustrated by an incident:</p>

<table class="tablea" summary="exercise a">

 <tr><th>Outside.</th><th><i>Inside.</i></th></tr>
 <tr><td>Alms.</td><td>Alms.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Prayer.</td><td>Prayer.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Fasting.</td><td>Fasting.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>Treasures.</td><td>Treasures.</td></tr>

</table>

 <p class="gap-above">Another good lesson on the board is to take one of the commandments,
 for instance, the "Third Commandment." Raise three questions and get
 the children to fill out the answers as follows:</p>

 <p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>

 Other points of instruction and application may be derived from the
 careful study of the above arrangement.</p>

 <p class="gap-above">The following, by E. D. Jones, of St. Louis, teaches a lesson from
 the text, John xii.&nbsp;32: "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth,
 will draw all men unto me." <i>First</i>, Notice the influences God
 uses to draw men: 1. The Holy Spirit. 2. The Bible. 3. The Churches.
 <i>Secondly</i>, Look at their relations: 1. As a Helper. 2. As a
 Teacher. 3. As a Trainer. <i>Thirdly</i>, Look at the chief work of
 these agents: 1. To Reveal.&nbsp;2. To Believe. 3. To Know. 4. To Train.

<h3><i>Map Drawing.&mdash;Palestine.</i></h3>

<p>Another use for the blackboard in the Sunday-school
is the drawing of maps and outlines of the
location of sacred places. Teachers have found it
difficult, however, if not impossible, to draw maps
of the proper proportions and rightly to locate the
places. The following simple plan, used by Ritter
and Guyot, has been extensively used in our Sunday-school
Conventions the last year or two, and found to
be useful. It is called the "Relative Measurement"
method. One line, say from A to B (see diagram on
page 123), is taken as the unit of measurement. This
line is 40 miles in length. Having drawn this line at
the top or northern boundary of Palestine, next dot
off five times forty miles south, and number it in proper
proportions, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then run three times
forty miles west, and number 6, 7, and 8. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
draw a line from A, sloping to the figure 8, for the
coast-line, and you have the general outline of Palestine.
Then run another dotted line from A to 6, and
you have the Jordan line. The River Jordan rises
opposite 1. The Sea of Galilee lies opposite No. 2.
The Dead Sea opposite 4 and 5. The principal
mountains are designated as /\ H. for Hermon, etc.
Cities by * and letters, as Jer. for Jerusalem, C. for
Cæsarea, etc. (See table.)</p>

<p>The great divisions are made by drawing a curved
line from Mount Carmel to the Jordan, midway between
2 and 3. Then equidistant between 3 and 4
draw a circular line to the coast of the Mediterranean
Sea. The length of the Holy Land is about 180
miles and the width from 25 to 70 miles.</p>

<p>The Sea of Galilee is 12 miles long by 6 broad,
and the Dead Sea is about 50 miles long. The
following outline, which appeared in part in <i>The
Sunday-School Teacher</i>, of Chicago, is a good illustration:</p>

<div class="small">

 <p class="center"><i>Table of Localities.</i><br />

of blackboard exercises, which I have selected as
being the most practical. Other more fanciful ones

the true, legitimate use of the blackboard does not

<h2>XV.<br />
THE INFANT-SCHOOL.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is no department of the Sabbath-school
work of greater importance and
interest than this. We have known marked
cases of hopeful conversion of children from four to
seven years of age to result from the first hour of
Bible instruction in the youngest infant classes.
Often the character and habits of scholars as such are
formed at the very first interview with their teacher,
who thus meets them at the very entering in of "the
gates of life." It is well known that some of our
most distinguished divines, as well as active Christian
ladies, date their conversion back to the early
age of four, five, or six years. Therefore take
measures in every Sabbath-school to organize and
sustain a first-class infant-school department.</p>

<p>1. Get a light, warm, airy room. A lean-to added
to your chapel for the purpose, or the use of the
next-door neighbor's dining-room for an hour a
week, will answer. Give the children a room by
themselves if possible, to rise and sing, talk, recite,
and pray. Furnish the room with a good blackboard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and crayons, and such Scripture prints and
cards and maps as you can obtain for the walls and
for use. Provide for them small, comfortable seats.</p>

<p>2. Select and call to the charge of this class the
most pious, bright, cheerful, patient, loving, gentle,
winning teacher for children there is to be found in
the whole church, with a like assistant. Generally
the teacher will be a lady, although some men
greatly excel as infant-class teachers, so that the
complaining remark of the little girl to her mother,
that she "hadn't any teacher to-day&mdash;it was only a
<i>man</i>," was quite too severe to be just. The little ones
are greatly blessed in their love for their teachers,
for they want a large share of demonstrative, life-like
sympathy, expressed by a soft, loving voice and
a gentle manner&mdash;hands that will speak in all their
gestures, and a patience that endureth and a heart
that loves to teach them for Christ's sake. If the
teacher feels the need of learning how to do this
good work, let him visit good week-day infant-schools,
and gather up suggestions and lessons, as
well as confidence and inspiration, for the great
work.</p>

<p>3. Visit and gather in all the children from the
ages of three or four to seven years, whose parents
are willing to send them, and at once teach them
habits of punctuality, order, regularity, and pleasant
worship. When they become well drilled and instructed,
so that they can clearly read the Bible, then
transfer them to older classes, unless there are good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
reasons to the contrary. Although they are little,
they are very precious, and amply worth all the painstaking
effort you can make for them.</p>

<p>4. Let the teacher of such a class ponder and consider
the characteristics of his precious charge.
1. <i>Activity.</i>&mdash;Says Mr. Hassell, "A healthful child
abhors quietude," and rightly so, as much as nature
does a vacuum. Every mother knows that her little
ones, if in health, "cannot bear to be still for a
minute." 2. <i>Curiosity.</i>&mdash;Archbishop Whately says:
"Curiosity is the parent of attention." 3. <i>Inquisitiveness.</i>&mdash;Happy
is that child who is blest with a
mother or teacher who will "bide patiently all the
endless questionings of the little one, and will not
rudely crush the rising spirit of free inquiry with an
impatient nod or a frown." Rather see in their
many questions but the untutored pleadings of the
little ones for care and cultivation. Oh, how much
they want and deserve to have their inquisitiveness
satisfied by a kind, considerate answer to all their
questions! 4. <i>Fear.</i>&mdash;Oh, how much children suffer
from this cause! Their natural timidity should
be respected, and not cruelly wrought upon. 5. Then,
too, children have <i>wonder</i>, and like to talk and hear
of "wonderful things." 6. They have also a proper
love of approbation, and they should be cheered and
encouraged when they try to do well.</p>

<p>Now let the teacher take up the first of these well-known
characteristics, and act upon it. An excellent
teacher of an infant class, some years ago, was accustomed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
to gain order by appealing to their <i>love of
activity</i>. She would stand quietly at the desk and
ask the children: "Children, will you please tell me
what the gods of the heathen are like?" This was
always a pleasing request to them, and every form
would stand erect, with every hand by their sides, and
they would together begin the part of the 115th
Psalm which answers that question. They would
repeat all together, "Eyes have they, but they see
not," and every pair of little hands would go with
the teacher's, pointing to, and resting upon, their
eyes. In like manner, "mouths have they," "noses,"
"ears," "feet," "hands," etc., always suiting the
action to the word. All are in perfect order, and the
next step for the teacher would naturally be to talk a
little about the gods of the heathen, and then sing a
verse about "bowing down to gods of wood and
stone." The transition is then natural and easy to
"Our God" in heaven, where angels, saints, parents,
and children too, are; and they sing the hymn to
which all leads, viz.: "Around the throne of God
in heaven, Thousands of children stand," etc., etc.</p>

<p>Another mode of conducting an infant-school is to
place the children in little classes, of six scholars,
with a teacher for each, and proceed with singing,
repeating commandments, singing, recitation for ten
minutes, study of emblems, a ten-minute address,
and prayers, having a verse or two of singing between
every exercise, and no exercise longer than
ten minutes. Thus an excellent system of infant-class
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
instruction proceeds, while the lady who has
charge gives the address and superintends the
teachers, etc., for the hour devoted to the school.</p>

<p>Another way is to take the two central verses of
the regular lesson for the whole school and bring it
out on the blackboard, and question, instruct, and
pray and sing about the same thought of God in the
lesson; as, "Who formed you, child, and made you
live?" <i>Ans.</i> "God did my life and spirit give," etc.,
with singing and prayer.</p>

<p>Another infant-class teacher has a different plan,
as follows: She has arranged with a gentleman, who
teaches a large class of young ladies of sixteen to
twenty years of age, to come in with his class and
conduct the opening exercises of the infant-school.
He then goes into another room and instructs his
class for thirty minutes, and the lady instructs the
children for the same time. Then the Bible-class,
with their teacher, return, and the infant-school is
divided into classes, in which the young ladies teach
the same lesson which they have just received from
their teacher. In this way practice in teaching, and
variety are gained, and the lady teacher in the infant-school
is relieved of a part of her burden.</p>

<p>I have never found two infant-class teachers who
conducted their schools exactly alike. Each one has
some peculiarity in his or her mode. There is no
standard mode of infant-class instruction. Adaptation
according to circumstances is the rule. The
children should be received with great care into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
infant-school, and be given to understand that it is a
place for the holy worship of God, and to learn of him.
The children should always be greeted by the teacher
with a loving smile, that is free from every trace of giddiness,
and with words of sincere, respectful welcome.
Great evil is done if the teacher is cold,
morose, or fretful in spirit or manner. The teacher
should pray with, as well as for, the children. They
may repeat the words of the prayer after the teacher;
and it is well to prepare them for the act, by some
such remark as, "Children, we want to thank God
this morning for this holy Sabbath, for the Sabbath-school,
for kind teachers, for the blessed Bible, for
our God and Saviour Jesus Christ," and so on, mentioning
the different objects of desire. Let the
prayers always be short and simple, and sing but one,
two or three verses at a time. The addresses should
always be clear and suited to the children. An
excellent model of scriptural talks to infant-class
children will be found in "Peep of Day," "Line
upon Line," and "Precept upon Precept." "The
Tract Primer" and "Child's Scripture Question
Book" have also some good things to work up for
infant-classes. There are various other helps from
which good suggestions can be gathered.</p>

<p>The children should recite their verse or verses
simultaneously; then by benches, or classes, and then
by a few individual scholars called upon, so as to
ascertain if all have learned it. The time cannot be
wasted by hearing each scholar recite in turn where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
there are only one or two teachers. Care should be
taken not to burden the young mind. A small,
bright, clear, pleasant Bible truth is best. As the
good Dr. Ryland used to say, "Simplify and repeat:
Simplify and repeat," remembering that simplicity
is not poverty of expression. Learn, also, how to
carry thoughts <i>into</i> a child's mind, and not leave
them, as many do, at the doorway. Aim at Christ
and salvation. Let no hymn be sung which you
are not, beforehand, careful to see that the children
really understand. Make every truth clear and simple,
and let them act the lesson out with appropriate
gesticulations and motions. When speaking of God,
let them do it reverently, and perhaps by all pointing
their little fingers upward.</p>

<p>Bible stories and anecdotes are generally best and
most interesting for infant-classes. Use the blackboard
freely with words and appropriate figures, for
such little ones learn best that which they learn
through the eye. Teach little at a time, but teach
that little well and thoroughly, is a grand motto for
the infant-class teacher.</p>

<p>It is of great importance that the children should
always feel that their teachers are the best and
happiest persons they ever saw, and that they are
always so very bright and happy because the religion
of Jesus makes them so full of love and joy,
and they cannot help its overflow; and that they
consider it the greatest privilege of life thus to tell
their scholars of Jesus, and lead the little children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
cheerfully along Zion's road towards the heavenly
Canaan.</p>

<h3><i>Examples of Infant-class Lessons.</i></h3>

<h4><i>Example No. 1.</i></h4>

<p>The following lesson was publicly taught by
Ralph Wells before the Philadelphia Sunday-School
Teachers' Institute, in September, 1867. and phonographically
reported for the columns of <i>The Sunday-School
Times</i>. The class was composed of some
twenty children:</p>

<div class="small">

<p class="center"><i>The Lesson.</i></p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Teacher.</span>&mdash;Look around just for a moment, children, and see
 how many people are looking at us. I want you to have one good look,
 and then to give me all the rest of your attention. After you have
 had your look, I want you to sing a little with me. [The children
 face the audience for a moment, smiling, parents and teachers
 returning their gaze with fond affection, and shall we not say, with
 many prayers that the lesson might be abundantly blessed?]</p>

 <p>Now let me see how exactly you can repeat the hymn after me. I will
 speak first, and you will follow me:</p>

   <p class="center smaller">"Jesus loves me, this I know,"</p>

 <p class="nodent">[Children repeat, in earnest harmony.]</p>

   <p class="center smaller">"For the Bible tells me so."</p>

 <p class="nodent">[Children repeat thus, after the teacher, the first stanza.]</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Teacher.</span>&mdash;"Jesus loves me." Let us look at this a moment. We
 think that praying and reading the Bible, and saying the lesson are
 worshipping God; and so they are; but we often forget that in reading
 and singing these beautiful Sabbath-school hymns we are worshipping
 God, too.</p>

<p class="center smaller"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
   "Jesus loves me, this I know,<br />
   For the Bible tells me so."</p>

 <p>[After the hymn was sweetly sung, the teacher talked very pleasantly
 about the beautiful Letter which our dear heavenly Father has sent to
 us.] That Letter is the blessed Bible. We are going to have a lesson
 out of it to-night. But we cannot understand it unless our Father
 sends some one to open our hearts to understand it. We have sung a
 verse to him: now we will look to him in prayer and ask him to be our
 Teacher. [The class close their eyes, fold their hands, and repeat
 the prayer after their teacher.]</p>

 <p>Dear Lord Jesus!&mdash;We thank thee for the Bible&mdash;we thank thee that it
 tells us&mdash;that God loves us&mdash;that he sent Jesus to die for us.&mdash;We
 thank thee&mdash;for all its promises;&mdash;that it tells us&mdash;if we love
 Jesus&mdash;and trust in him&mdash;we shall go to heaven;&mdash;that if we love
 Jesus&mdash;and trust in him&mdash;he will never leave us.&mdash;To-night, dear
 Father&mdash;send the blessed Spirit&mdash;to make us attentive&mdash;to help us to
 find Jesus&mdash;and what he would have us to do&mdash;and how we can get to
 heaven.&mdash;O dear Saviour!&mdash;sometimes when we try&mdash;we find it very
 hard&mdash;to do right.&mdash;Let us never be discouraged&mdash;but whenever we
 sin&mdash;go to Jesus and tell him all&mdash;and get his help.&mdash;Dear
 Jesus&mdash;help us to live for thee&mdash;to do good while we live&mdash;to be a
 blessing to all around us&mdash;and to show that we love thee&mdash;in our
 homes&mdash;to little brothers and sisters&mdash;and to all our companions&mdash;at
 home&mdash;at school&mdash;and everywhere.&mdash;May we so live&mdash;that everybody
 shall see&mdash;that we are Jesus' little lambs.&mdash;Hear our prayer&mdash;and
 come to-night and be our Teacher&mdash;and may our little
 hearts&mdash;to-night&mdash;be given away to Jesus&mdash;to love and serve him&mdash;as
 long as we live.&mdash;We ask for Jesus' sake.&mdash;Amen.</p>

 <p>[This simple petition was offered by the children, as with one voice,
 the tone and accentuation of the leader being caught up and carried
 by them with affecting earnestness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
 of pleading. One could not but feel that the exercise was
 <i>real</i>, with both teacher and class.]</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Teacher.</span>&mdash;Now sing with me one verse more, children, and we
 will take a Bible lesson together. It is new to you, but we sung it
 over once this afternoon, and I guess you can sing it now. I will
 sing one verse for you, because it is new to you, and then we will
 sing it together. It begins with</p>

   <p class="center smaller">"Oh, I must be a lover of the Lord!"</p>

 <p class="nodent">Let me sing it for you. [Teacher sings.]</p>

<div class="poetry-center">
<div class="poetry">

   <div class="line quote smaller">"Oh, I must be a lover of the Lord,</div>
   <div class="line smaller">Oh, I must be a lover of the Lord,</div>
   <div class="line smaller">Oh, I must be a lover of the Lord,</div>
   <div class="line indent1 smaller">Or I can't go to heaven when I die."</div>

</div>
</div>

 <p>[The children then sing it with Mr. Wells, and finally by themselves,
 clearly, loudly and accurately.]</p>

 <p>There is a little sentence of only four words, children, that has
 been more precious to me than any other in the world. I wrote it on a
 piece of paper years ago, and put it in my pocket-book&mdash;here it is,
 with little flowers around it&mdash;[Producing it and holding it up to the
 class.] Would you like me to give you these four words? <i>Yes,
 sir!</i> Well, I will write them on the board. [Writes:]</p>

<div class="boxb">

 <p><i>Christ died for me.</i></p>

</div>

 <p>I do not know whether you can read&mdash;[the children, quickly
 interrupting, read "<i>Christ died for me</i>".] Yes, if ever this
 world loves Jesus, it will be because these four little words get
 into everybody's heart. Try and remember them.</p>

 <p>I am now going to read a verse out of our Father's Letter. It is a
 sad story. After I read it, I am going to tell it to you in my way;
 and after I have told it to you, I am going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
 to ask you, to see if you can tell me all about it. Then I am going
 to tell you the meaning; then the lesson&mdash;three things: the story,
 the meaning, the lesson. Can you give them to me? First,
 the&mdash;<i>story</i>, next, the&mdash;<i>meaning</i>, and last,
 the&mdash;<i>lesson</i>, [the children say.] Once more, give them to
 me.&mdash;<i>Story, meaning, lesson.</i></p>

 <p>I will read it first out of the Bible, for I always want to give you
 God's word first; then I will tell it to you. It is in the twelfth
 chapter of the Book of Exodus. "Exodus" means the "going out." When
 you leave this room you "go out" of it&mdash;it is your "Exodus" of the
 room. So, in the Bible story, God's people went out. Let me read to
 you:</p>

 <p>"Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them,
 Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the
 passover. And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the
 blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two
 side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall
 go out at the door of his house until the morning. For the Lord will
 pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon
 the lintel, and on the two side-posts, the Lord will pass over the
 door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses
 to smite you."</p>

 <p>And it happened just as God said. Now, I do not want to tell you
 anything that you can tell me. In the first place, we want to find
 out where this took place. Can any of you tell me the name of the
 country? [<i>Egypt!</i> shout three or four little voices&mdash;to the
 surprise even of the teacher, who, as well as the audience, was
 repeatedly astonished at the accuracy, promptness, and clearness of
 the children's answers.]</p>

 <p>The Israelites, or God's people, are spoken of in the lesson. They
 are now in Egypt. Let me mark it on the board. Here is <i>Egypt</i>,
 [drawing a rough outline of the Red Sea,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
 river Nile, and the Mediterranean; and, proceeding northerly, of
 Palestine.] Pointing to the latter, the teacher said, Here
 is&mdash;<i>Canaan</i>, one child replied. Yes! that little girl has it.
 And what city is this? [making a dot near the corner of the Dead
 Sea.] Je-<i>rusalem!</i> [a little boy finishes the word.] God's
 people had been dwelling in Canaan; how did they come to be in Egypt,
 where we find them in our lesson? Who first went down to get corn?
 <i>Joseph.</i> Yes. There was no corn in the land. What do you call
 it when there is nothing to eat? <i>Famine!</i> a bright boy replies.
 Very well, indeed. Who, then, went first to buy corn? <i>Joseph.</i>
 And who followed him? <i>His brethren.</i> What did they go for?&mdash;to
 keep them from&mdash;<i>Starving!</i> That is it, exactly. I like to hear
 children answer so well. Can any of you tell me how many Israelites
 or Jews there were in Egypt? How many is that? [Writing the figures
 2,000,000 on the board.] <i>Two million!</i> [eagerly responded a
 little fellow, who certainly did credit to his week-day instructors.]
 Yes, there were probably two million&mdash;men, women, and children. What
 was the name of the king of Egypt? It begins with P.&mdash;<i>Pharaoh.</i>
 Yes, God said to him, "Let my people&mdash;<i>go</i>." but Pharaoh said,
 "I&mdash;<i>won't</i>!" Then God said, "I will show him what I will do. My
 people shall go, that they may serve me." So God told his people to
 get ready that night, when our lesson begins.</p>

 <p>What should you think this was? [Drawing a rough figure of the face
 of a clock.] <i>A clock.</i> Yes. What hour is the hand pointing to?
 <i>Twelve o'clock.</i> What time of night do you call that?
 <i>Midnight.</i> Yes, at midnight God said he would go from house to
 house in the land of Egypt, and every house where he did not see
 something on the door he would go in and kill the first-born. Let us
 make a door, now. [Drawing the outline of a door.] We won't take time
 to draw it very nicely. "Every house where I see something on the
 door," God said. What was it he must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
 see on the door? <i>Blood!</i> <i>blood!</i> [Taking the red crayon,
 spots of red are dotted here and there over the white door-posts,
 representing blood.] Yes; wherever I see the blood of a little killed
 lamb on the door, I will not go in and slay the first-born.</p>

 <p>This blood must first be in a&mdash;[Drawing an outline of a bowl or
 basin,]&mdash;<i>Basin</i>, the children reply. Yes; and how are you to
 get the blood on the door? [Taking the green chalk, and drawing a
 bush.] Here is a little bush, called hyssop, something like a
 huckleberry bush, and the people were to take that and dip it in the
 basin, into the blood, and do what? <i>Sprinkle it on the door!</i>
 Yes. What part of the door? (A pause.) L-i-n-t-e-l; what does that
 spell? <i>Lintel.</i></p>

 <p>Then, "when I see the&mdash;<i>blood</i>&mdash;on the&mdash;<i>lintel</i>&mdash;and on
 the two&mdash;<i>side-posts</i>&mdash;I will not go in and&mdash;<i>kill the
 first-born</i>!" Yes. That was what God said.</p>

 <p>I have sometimes thought I could see an Egyptian soldier that night
 with his armor on, going up to one of the Israelites and asking,
 "What is that you are putting on the door?" "It is some lamb's
 blood." "What are you putting it on for?" "Because my God has told me
 to." Then with a strut he has turned on his heel and walked away,
 muttering to himself, "What a big fool that Jew is!"</p>

 <p>But see! the hands on the clock begin to get around. It is now
 pointing to&mdash;<i>midnight</i>. Yes, pretty soon it strikes
 one&mdash;two&mdash;three, up to&mdash;<i>twelve</i>. And then! Oh! the angel of
 death went from one house to another, and in every one that didn't
 have&mdash;<i>the blood</i>&mdash;on it, the first-born was&mdash;<i>killed</i>.
 Yes! And one wail of woe went up from Egypt that night. Fathers and
 mothers, from Pharaoh in his beautiful palace, to his poorest
 servant, were weeping and wailing and lamenting their first-born,
 slain by the hand of the angel of God.</p>

 <p>But some houses escaped. The ones with the&mdash;<i>blood</i> on.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
 Had there been any death in those houses? <i>No, sir.</i> Think. What
 had died? <i>A little lamb.</i> Yes; a little lamb had been killed
 and his blood put in&mdash;<i>a basin</i>. And then&mdash;suppose the basin had
 been set behind the door, would that have done? <i>No, sir.</i> The
 blood must be sprinkled on the&mdash;<i>door</i>, and it most be sprinkled
 by a bunch of&mdash;<i>hyssop</i>. Yes; it must all be done exactly as God
 had said. Then the door that had the blood upon it was passed over by
 the angel, was it? <i>Yes, sir.</i> And what was done to the house
 where there was no blood? What did the angel do? <i>Went in.</i> Yes,
 and&mdash;<i>slew the first-born</i>. [Mr. Wells then called a little boy
 up to the board, drew a rough sketch of three or four door-frames, on
 two of which he used the red chalk, making marks to represent blood.
 The boy was then asked, with the class, to point out which houses the
 angel would enter, and which pass over, thus drilling the fact
 impressively and perfectly into the scholars' minds, as also the
 reason for the angel's choice&mdash;the <i>blood</i> of the lamb.]</p>

 <p>How do you think I got here? <i>On the cars.</i> What drew the cars?
 <i>An engine.</i> Did you ever see an engine? <i>Yes, sir!</i> (with
 emphasis). This summer, where I live, at Tarrytown, a gentleman said
 to me, "Don't you want to go down on the track and see the express
 train go by to-night?" I said yes: so we went. By-and-by I heard a
 rumble: it seemed to come nearer and nearer, and got louder and
 louder. What was coming? <i>The express train.</i> Yes, it was going
 to rush by us at thirty miles an hour. Could we have held out our
 hands and stopped it? <i>No, sir!</i> (emphatically, and
 incredulously). Suppose we had had you to help us, could we then?
 <i>No, sir!</i> Well, suppose all the people in this house had caught
 hold of the cars?&mdash;what then? <i>It would have pulled them to
 pieces!</i> [a little girl says]. Well, in a minute or two I heard a
 sharp <i>toot! toot!</i>&mdash;what was that? <i>The whistle.</i> Yes, and
 the man on the engine put his hand on a little iron bar and pushed
 it, and the cars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
 began to go slower and slower and slower until they stopped. The man
 put his hand on the right place, the place of power, the place that
 made the engine go or stop. Now, what does Jesus say to us? "Behold,
 I stand at the door and knock." Can you tell me at what door Jesus
 knocks? <i>Our hearts.</i> "If any man," or child, "will hear my
 voice, and open&mdash;<i>the door</i>&mdash;I will come in and&mdash;<i>sup with
 him</i>." Yes, "and he with me;" and we shall be saved. But there
 must be something on the door, or we cannot be saved, any more than
 the Jews, if they forgot, or would not, put the blood on the doors of
 their houses. What must we have on the door? <i>Blood</i>. Yes. Well,
 will it do if you cut your finger, and sprinkle the blood on your
 house? <i>No, sir.</i> Suppose you kill a little lamb, and put the
 blood on your front door, will that save you? <i>No, sir, no,
 sir!</i> What must the blood be on? <i>Our hearts!</i> Yes, the blood
 must be put upon the right place, the place where Jesus knocks, the
 place of power. Our hearts then are&mdash;<i>the door</i>. And what must
 be sprinkled on the door? <i>Blood.</i></p>

 <p>Why did our soldiers go off to the war? <i>To fight</i>; yes, and to
 shed their&mdash;<i>blood</i>&mdash;for their country. And what does shedding
 their blood mean? <i>They died</i>&mdash;[a little girl answers]. Right;
 they shed their blood, they died for our country. Jesus shed his
 blood, That means the same as Jesus&mdash;<i>died</i>; yes; how? <i>On the
 cross.</i> He hung there for you, did he? <i>Yes, sir.</i> And for
 me? <i>Yes, sir</i>; and for us all? A little girl in a
 mission-school, named Mary, sat on the front seat, and when the
 superintendent was telling about how they hanged Jesus on the cross,
 the tears came to her eyes, and when he got to where they took the
 hammer and the nails to nail him, little Mary could not stand it any
 longer, but she had to get up and go out. In the afternoon she came
 back smiling, and the superintendent asked her, "Mary, where did you
 go this morning?" and she said, "Oh, teacher, I could not stand it
 when you spoke to us about Jesus being nailed on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
 cross, for I felt just as if I helped to pound the nails in, and I
 went off a little piece from the school, and got down on my knees and
 told Jesus that my sins helped to hang him on the cross, and I asked
 him to please forgive me for helping to kill him&mdash;that I was so
 sorry; but now I feel so happy." Jesus forgave her, and to-day Mary
 is a little Christian girl.</p>

 <p>I have something in my pocket (drawing out a roll) that I want you to
 see. Years ago I went thousands of miles away, and I sent on to
 Washington and got this paper, It is called a "passport." There is
 the great seal of the United States on it, and here is the
 Secretary's signature at the bottom. And when I was away, in strange
 countries, where I could not speak the language, all I had to do was
 to show this paper, and they said, "Let him pass," or something that
 meant that, and I was allowed to go on. If I had not had this
 passport, I could not have got through. The blood of Jesus must be
 our passport. When God sees this blood sprinkled on the door of our
 hearts, he will say, "Let him pass," and we will be allowed to go
 through this life in safety, and get to heaven when we die. But oh,
 how many times we have to use this passport! How often we sin and
 need to come to Jesus for forgiveness, and to point to his precious
 blood sprinkled on our hearts!</p>

</div>

<p>The teacher further continued the lesson, illustrating
by pointed and affecting incidents, briefly recapitulating,
and closing with a short prayer, in which
the little ones feelingly joined. The above is all
that need be quoted to give an idea of the style of
this successful teacher of the children.</p>

<h4><i>Example No. 2.</i></h4>

<p>The following lesson was kindly forwarded to the
author, in manuscript, from London, by the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
lady teacher, "S. E. A.," who has been remarkably
successful in public exercises of teaching very young
children.</p>

<div class="small">

 <p class="center"><i>A Lesson upon Forgiveness.</i></p>

 <p>Harry and Fred went to school. They had to cross a road to get to it.
 A boy used to stand at the crossing with a broom in his hand to sweep
 it with; this boy was very rude to Harry and Fred: he used to try and
 keep them from crossing the road. Once he took away Fred's books and
 splashed him with mud. When the boy saw Harry and Fred running and
 making haste, lest they should be late at school, he would be sure to
 stop them. In the winter-time he made them walk upon the snow.
 Sometimes he held up his broom before their faces and cried out,
 "Can't come across, can't come across; you'll be late, you'll have
 the stick." Then, again, when they were very early, he would tell
 them they were late, and so make them run. At last, one day all the
 children of the school to which Harry and Fred went were going to
 take flowers to their teacher, as it was her birthday. Henry said
 that he would bring a beautiful nosegay, for his papa's gardener was
 going to cut him a large one from the green-house for him to take to
 school. Well, the morning of the birthday came: the school-children
 brought a great many beautiful flowers; Harry and Fred did not come
 with the rest; the children wondered where they could be. At last
 though, in they came, but no nosegay: they made a bow, said
 "Good-morning," and then both looked down on the ground. "Where's
 your nosegay?" said a little girl to Harry. "I have not got one," he
 answered. How could that have happened? The gardener had cut them a
 beautiful large nosegay, and when they left home in the morning for
 school they had it with them&mdash;what had become of it? Had the boy
 taken it away? I will tell you all about it. As they were running
 along very fast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
 to get to school in time, all at once they left off running and began
 to walk slowly. They were near the crossing, and they felt afraid of
 the boy; they need not have been frightened, for the boy was sitting
 down on a doorstep crying, with his head resting upon his knees, and
 took no notice of them. As they were going past him, Harry said, "Oh,
 he will not hurt us; let us stop; I wonder what he is crying for?"
 "What is the matter?" said Fred to him. "Mind your own business,"
 answered the boy; "go on to school." So on they went, but as they
 turned away the boy saw the nosegay, and called after them to come
 back. "Don't go." said Fred: "he's a wicked boy; we can't help him."
 Well, they were going on when Harry looked again and saw him crying;
 so he and Fred turned back: then the boy told them that he was very
 hungry, that his mother and grandmother were both at home very hungry
 and ill, that a policeman had turned him away from his crossing, and
 he had not earned any money for three days. Harry said, "Poor
 fellow!" and he wished he had a penny to give the poor boy. Then
 Harry and Fred looked at their flowers; the boy looked too. "He can't
 have our flowers, you know," said Fred; "we want them for our
 teacher, she is so kind, and I want to show how much I love her." So
 they walked off slowly, and the boy looked after them and the nosegay
 as if he would like very much to have it. "I say he does not deserve
 to be helped," said Fred. "So do I," said Harry; "and then these
 flowers are too good to give to him." However, they did not feel
 quite comfortable, and then they remembered a text they had learned
 at school the day before&mdash;"<i>If ye forgive not men their trespasses,
 neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</i>" That is, dear
 children, if we do not forgive others, God will not forgive us. So
 Harry said, "Here, Fred! take the flowers to him." Fred took the
 flowers, went up to the boy, put them in his hand, and then ran away.
 A gentleman soon after gave the boy a shilling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
 for the nosegay, and I dare say you can guess what he did with it.
 When Harry and Fred gave the nosegay to the boy, it made them feel
 very happy&mdash;more happy than if they had given it to their teacher;
 and it did the boy good too: their kindness made all his rudeness go
 away, and always after this day he did all he could to please Harry
 and Fred.</p>

 <p><i>Tell</i> me the names of the boys I have spoken to you about?
 <i>How</i> did the crossing-sweeper behave to them? <i>What</i> were
 they going to take to school one day? <i>Why</i>? <i>Did</i> Harry
 and Fred take their nosegay to school? <i>What</i> did they do with
 it? <i>Did</i> the boy deserve to have it? <i>Why</i> did they give
 it to him then? Yes, they gave it to him to show that they had
 forgiven him. Sometimes people are unkind to you; perhaps one day a
 boy went up to you James, and stole your marbles; perhaps your big
 sister one day gave you a slap, Mary. Now, if she ever slaps you
 again, or if the boy takes away James's marbles again, are you to hit
 them and call them hard names, or to forgive them? <i>Why?</i> Yes,
 you should forgive them because God wishes you to do so; because it
 will be acting like Jesus to do so; because God will not forgive you
 if you do not forgive. Let us think a little about Jesus. You know
 that one evening when he was praying in a quiet garden, some wicked
 men came and dragged him away; you remember how the soldiers mocked
 him, took off his clothes, put on him an old robe, a make-believe
 crown made of thorns&mdash;dared to be so filthy as to spit in his face,
 beat him; and then they put great nails through his hands and through
 his feet, and nailed him to a cross of wood, put it up and let him
 hang there. How the nails most have torn his hands!&mdash;what great pain
 they must have given him! You know if a pin were put through your
 flesh how the pain would make you cry out; what then must have been
 the pain of the nails! And then he did not deserve this cruel
 treatment: he had gone about doing good. If any persons deserved to
 be punished, those who put Jesus, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
 kind, loving Saviour, to death, deserved to be; and Jesus could have
 punished them if he had chosen, for he was God's dear Son; but no, he
 did not punish them. Instead of that, he prayed for them: he said,
 "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do!" Let us ask
 God, the Holy Spirit, to give us a forgiving spirit, and so make as
 like Jesus.</p>

 <p>Here is a story which Jesus once told, that he might teach us to
 forgive others: A king once had a servant who owed him ten thousand
 pieces of money. When the king called the servant that he might pay
 back the money, the servant had nothing to pay: not even one piece of
 money could he pay back, and he owed&mdash;ten thousand. Then the king
 ordered that the servant and his wife and children should be sold as
 slaves, and work until there was enough money to pay back the ten
 thousand pieces. When the servant heard this he fell down on his face
 before the king, and said, "Lord, have patience with me, and I will
 pay thee all;" in other words, "Do wait a little longer and I will
 pay back all the money." Suppose Alfred's mother owes the baker for a
 great many loaves, and he was to come to her house one day and say,
 "I must have my money; I won't go away till you pay it to me;" and
 then your mother were to cry, and tell him how sorry she was she had
 no money, but that the children had been ill, and that she had had to
 give all her money to the doctor, but that if he would wait a week
 longer she would get the money and pay him. Well, suppose the baker
 was to feel quite sorry for your mother, and should say, "Well, I
 won't ask you for the money: you need not pay me at all. I will give
 you the bread you've had." Now, that is what this king did. The
 servant said, "Wait a little longer and I will pay you." The king
 said, "You need not pay me at all: I forgive you it all." The servant
 went away. As he was going away he met a man who owed him a hundred
 pennies: he went up to him, laid hold of him very rudely by the
 throat, and said, "Pay me what you owe me!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
 The man fell down at his feet, and said, "Have patience with me, and
 I will pay you all." <i>How</i> much money had the king just forgiven
 the servant? <i>How</i> much did this man owe the servant?
 <i>What</i> ought he to have done? But he did not forgive him, but
 had him put in prison directly. Some servants were standing by and
 saw what this unkind servant had done, so they went to the king and
 told him all about it. He ordered the servant to be brought back
 before him, and then the king said to him, "O you wicked servant I
 forgave you all that debt: ought you not to have forgiven the poor
 man what he owed you?" The king was very angry with him, and had him
 put in prison until he paid the very last farthing. Then Jesus told
 the people to whom he was speaking that so their heavenly Father
 would not forgive them if they would not forgive one another.</p>

 <p><i>How</i> many pieces of money did the servant owe his lord?
 <i>Had</i> he any money to pay back with? <i>What</i> did the king
 order to be done to him and his wife and children? <i>What</i> did
 the servant then say? <i>Did</i> the king give him a little longer
 time? <i>How</i> much did a man owe this servant? <i>Tell</i> me how
 he treated the man? <i>Who</i> went and told the king all about it?
 <i>What</i> did the king <i>say</i> to the servant? <i>What</i> did
 he <i>do</i> to him? <i>Who</i> was it prayed for those who treated
 him so cruelly? <i>Now</i>, when you go home, I want you to tell your
 mothers and fathers about the lesson. Repeat it. If we do not forgive
 others, God will not forgive us. Try and remember three things&mdash;about
 Harry and Fred; the king and the servant; the Lord Jesus.</p>

YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN'S BIBLE-CLASSES.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capW-053.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE can hardly find words to convey our impression
of the surpassing importance of these classes. To train teachers, to train
mothers and fathers, to restrain from doubtful company,
and to furnish good companions and Christian
associations, reading, habits, impulses to the young
men and women of this generation, is a work
worthy of the highest aspirations of the best and
noblest of our race. If we look at the census, we
cannot fail to notice the striking fact that a little
more than <i>one-third</i> of the entire population of
New York are young men and women over fifteen
and under thirty years of age, while more than one-half
of our population is under twenty years of age.</p>

<p>In a very short time the destinies of our country
and of our churches will be in the hands of these
young people. To a large extent they have been
neglected in the family, in society, in the Sabbath-school,
and in the Church; and as Dr. James W.
Alexander said: "Be it ever remembered, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
neglecters of the Church have been neglected by the
Church." These young people can no longer be
petted as children, and they are not generally treated
with the respect due to them as rising young men and
women. Said a youth of fifteen once: "Uncle, I
don't know what I can do with myself. I am too
old to play with children, and I am not old enough to
be interesting to the older people." This anomalous
position such young people sadly feel. They are
sensitive, beyond any other period of life, to any
slight or neglect, and after a vain struggle to gain a
recognition and position anywhere, they rush to the
gilded saloons or the giddy dance for that sympathy,
kindness, and regard which they vainly seek for in
the family, the Sabbath-school and the Church of
Christ.</p>

<p>This should never be, and it must not be. But
can these persons be reached and gained by the
Sabbath-school? And how? After due consideration,
I reply, in the first place, that they <i>can</i> be
reached. My reasons are:</p>

<p>1. Because earnest, warm-hearted, disinterested
efforts in this direction have ever been successful.
When building the Brick Church in Rochester, N.Y.,
the names of all the scholars and their ages were
transcribed and placed in the corner-stone, when it
was ascertained that, of the whole number&mdash;I think
652&mdash;the average age was fourteen years and ten
months; and other churches in that city present a
similar record, because the able and influential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Christian business men and women of Rochester
devote themselves to this great work.</p>

<p>2. Because no class of persons is more susceptible
to kind attention and real sympathy. They are
quick to perceive and prompt to act. No class is
more hopeful.</p>

<p>3. Because these senior classes, when appropriately
conducted, are well adapted to meet the wants
of their personal, social, intellectual, and religious
nature, and to fill a secret void that is keenly felt by
these precious youth.</p>

<p>In the second place, <i>How</i> can our young men and
women be reached? I answer:</p>

<p>1. Christian men and women of real talent and
character, of religious and social position, must be
thoroughly aroused to a self-sacrificing, devoted,
heartfelt interest for them. They must put their
hearts into it. No feigned respect will do. Nothing
but real sympathy will be received. No mere professions
will answer. These youth are quick and
sharp-sighted to detect anything insincere or unreal.
The best men and women of our churches must be
chosen to take charge of their classes&mdash;persons who
can and will understand, appreciate, and respect
young people. They must evince a more anxious
and watchful desire to notice and approve what is
right in them, than to condemn that which is wrong.
They must be patient and forbearing, with a good
control of their countenance, tone of voice, language,
quick to discover the value and bearing of the half-uttered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
opinions of the class, with an earnest personal
interest in each one and all things that concern
them. They should be enabled to prove themselves
sincere friends and counsellors of all&mdash;both for this
life, in employment, business, social questions, amusements,
etc., and for the life that is to come. They
should have an intelligent enthusiasm in the great
work, with a strong faith in God, in his Word, and
in his Spirit, and a hearty good-will to man.</p>

<p>2. Lay your plans for these classes on so large
and liberal a scale as to command the scholars'
respect as well as your own. Render them as
pleasant and as attractive as possible. Make the best
arrangements you can as to room, seats, library, and
periodicals. I am sure <i>The Sunday-School Times</i>
and other Sabbath-school journals and magazines,
would be very useful in such a service. Do all you
can to raise these classes in their own estimation,
and omit no opportunity to cherish self-respect on
the part of each member, and try to inspire them all
with higher aspirations and better hopes. Manifest,
as well as feel, a <i>personal</i> interest in each one.</p>

<p>3. Aim high and direct. Have a distinct, definite
aim and object in all your teachings, and see that
each member of the class clearly understands it.
Young people want drawing out and leading forward
in gentle confidence. In these classes we
ought to select and train for the purpose our best
Sabbath-school teachers. If the exercises are allowed
to degenerate into unprofitable discussions, the examination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of curious questions, controversies, or skeptical
subjects, they may be productive of positive
evil. Care should be taken, therefore, to engross
them with the most ennobling themes. None can
better appreciate what is truly excellent than these
young people. An appeal to the Word and to the
Testimony they will understand and respect. Lead
them to compare Scripture with Scripture. Illustrate
the Old Testament from the New, and also bring
illustration for the New Testament from the Old.
Induce the young people to make the best use of a
good reference Bible, searching out parallel passages
for comparison, inference, and illustration, and all
will be interested and benefited. Use similes, metaphors,
etc., which so abound, as well as comparisons
and inferences. The following quotation may serve as
an illustration of four figures of speech, all brought
into one sentence:</p>

<p>"Imagine a father bewailing the loss of his son,
by drowning.</p>

<p class="indent1"><i>Simile</i>&mdash;He stood firmly upon the beach, like an oak of the
 forest,</p>

<p class="indent1a"><i>Metaphor</i>&mdash;and cried out, with trumpet voice,</p>

<p class="indent1a"><i>Hyperbole</i>&mdash;louder than the cannon's roar:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1a"><i>Apostrophe</i>&mdash;Oh ocean! thou hast robbed me of a beloved and
 courageous son."</p>

<p>4. The character, interests, and feelings of the
class should be the teacher's unwearied, daily study.
This will be a noble work. Nothing which concerns
them should be treated by the teacher with indifference.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
His profoundest thoughts, reading, observation,
and study should be laid under contribution to
his class. Painstaking saves thousands, neglect
ruins millions. Count no sacrifice too dear to win
souls.</p>

<p>5. It is indispensable that the teacher of such a
class should always be courteous. Religion should
at least make its possessor a gentleman, and this the
young people all know right well. His whole life
and bearing will influence the little circle. The
personal appearance also should be duly regarded.
Says a teacher: "The manner of a teacher should
always be marked by these qualities: 1. Animation&mdash;a
quickened, active state of the whole soul; 2. Intention&mdash;the
aim and endeavor to impart the information
required; 3. Earnestness&mdash;zeal in executing
the instruction."</p>

<p>6. The class should be consulted, as far as possible,
respecting the subject of study. The teacher
should lose no opportunity to evince his respect for
their opinions. His difficult questions should be
asked generally of the class, while the personal
questions should be easy and adapted. He should
receive all their answers with an abounding charity
and confidence, and make the most of the feeblest
responses. A tart reply to a single remark will
ofttimes seal the lips and hearts of a whole class.
They love confidence, and become afraid to trust a
teacher with their stammering, half-uttered, imperfect
answers, particularly if he appears more anxious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to be smart and witty than to do them good and
honor them. Let the lessons be systematic and
complete. The teacher should aim to draw out the
thoughts of his pupils in an easy way, instead of
pouring in his own. "<i>Thoughts</i>, not words," should
be the class-motto, and none can appreciate them
better than young people. Let the illustrations be
well-chosen and appropriate. If you strike an important
practical question during the lesson, do not
leave it until satisfactorily investigated, whether the
lesson is covered or not. Let every mind be calm
and unembarrassed, so that it will work well; much
depends upon the class, as well as upon the capacity
of the teacher. "A few pebbles, a piece of leather,
and a cord, are in some hands, a more formidable
weapon than the sword of a giant, although it be
strong as a weaver's beam and keen as a blade of
Damascus steel."</p>

<p>7. These young people should be especially induced
to look into their own hearts, and study their
own mental and moral mechanism. Lead them
often to converse about themselves. It has been
truly said, that "it is a law of human nature, that
man is interested in nothing so much as about himself."
Whatever relates to his own personal experience
always claims his especial regard. Many quite
fail as teachers, as well as preachers, because they are
so impersonal.</p>

<p>8. Social meetings of the class should be held now
and then, and pains should be taken to make them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
attractive and useful. Young men and women must
have their social nature regarded. The teacher
should on such occasions strive to recall the freshness
and vivacity of his own youth, and live it over
again; enter into it heartily, and show the class
his acquaintance and sympathy with all their peculiar
wants, fears, and trials. Band the young people
together, in social bonds and mutual pledges if you
please, to attend church, prayer-meeting, and Sabbath-school,
to read the Bible and pray <i>regularly</i>,
and perhaps pledge also against improper reading,
associates, games, drinking, smoking, late hours,
neglect of the Sabbath, and unite them in associated
literary efforts, in tract missions, Sabbath-school
work, in visitation, and in all ways of doing good.
There should be social prayer-meetings of the class
at convenient times. Have, also, a well-chosen
library for them, and point out from time to time the
books best adapted to peculiar wants and circumstances.</p>

<p>9. Give each pupil distinctly to understand that
every step in your efforts on his behalf is intended to
lead him to Christ; that all there is to be desired
in this life and in that which is to come, is embodied
in this idea; that you expect, as soon as they get
their minds clear upon the glad tidings of the gospel,
that they will embrace them at once. Life is
short, and there is no time to lose. Besides, young
people when convinced are generally prompt to act,
and therefore there is great encouragement. In fact,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
no field of benevolent effort is more full of hope and
encouragement than this one of which we speak. In
a Bible-class in one of our church Sabbath-schools
not long since, fifty-five persons united with that
church during the current year; and in another
church and class, <i>fifty</i>, and in another still, <i>thirty-four</i>&mdash;all
as the results of one year's labor. How
glorious! Let then our sons and daughters, our
clerks, scholars, and servant-girls, all be gathered
without delay by the churches of Christ into these
adult classes. Thus let the warm, burning influences
of the living teacher reach every youthful heart.
Says an earnest worker: "Among persons of all
ages, truth most frequently has power when spoken
by the living voice. The words of a teacher's mouth
should be ever warm with the Spirit's breath, and
strong with the vital impulses of his throbbing heart.
Such words children feel." In the language of one
of our Bible commentators, the truth evidently is this:
"<i>That personal effort for the souls of individuals</i>&mdash;the
lip, the thought, and the heart of a living man&mdash;brought
into contact with the lip, thought, and
heart of a living man, <small>IS A GRAND INSTITUTION OF
GOD FOR THE CONVERSION OF THE WORLD</small>."</p>

<p>There is such a great necessity for adapting each
lesson perfectly to the age, acquirements, etc., of the
scholar, that I add a single specimen lesson from
"The Sunday Teachers' Treasury." It is upon the
same subject as that taken up in Mr. Wells's infant-class
lesson&mdash;"The Passover"&mdash;and is given that, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
comparison of style, the adaptation of the same lesson
to infant and Bible-classes may be seen:</p>

<div class="small">

 <h3><i>Specimen Lesson for a Senior Class.<br />
 The Feast of the Passover.</i></h3>

 <p class="center">(Exodus xii.)</p>

 <p>Circumstances of the Israelites at this time; how solemn, how
 stirring, how intense in interest! The institution of the Passover
 seems to have a threefold design. It was&mdash;1. An act of faith and
 obedience on the part of Israel.&nbsp;2. A memorial of their deliverance.
 3. A type of Christ. In the last view we will study it to-day,
 looking less closely at those points which we had on a former
 occasion, and connecting with the actual celebration of the Passover
 that which God connected with it&mdash;the feast of unleavened bread and
 the offering of the first-fruits of the barley harvest.</p>

 <p>The Passover, then, was a type of Christ.</p>

 <p>I. The victim was to be a lamb; and this title is applied to Christ
 (John i.&nbsp;29).</p>

 <p>The first altar exhibits a lamb slain; the first act of God for
 Israel is the slaying of the lamb; the first deed of the new
 dispensation was presenting, and then offering, the Lamb; the first
 opening of the sanctuary above, shows the "Lamb that was slain."</p>

 <p>1. Without blemish (Matt. xxvii.&nbsp;4; 1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;19; Heb. vii.&nbsp;26).</p>

 <p>2. Set apart four days (ver. 3, 6; John xii.&nbsp;1, 12).</p>

 <p>3. Roasted with fire (Isa. liii.; Ps. xxii.; Luke xxii.&nbsp;44).</p>

 <p>4. Not a bone to be broken (John xix.&nbsp;33).</p>

 <p>5. All the congregation were to take part (ver. 6; Matt. xxvi.&nbsp;1;
 Acts ii.&nbsp;23-36).</p>

 <p>6. The blood was to be shed and sprinkled. Where? On the side-post
 and upper door-post; not on the floor, where it would be trampled on
 (compare 1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;19; Heb. x.&nbsp;29).

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
 It is not enough that Christ's blood is shed; it must be sprinkled on
 our hearts (Heb. xii.&nbsp;24; 1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;2). The act of sprinkling it upon
 the door-posts was equivalent to a profession, "I am the Lord's." It
 was the means of safety, "When <i>I see the blood</i>," etc.</p>

 <p>What encouragement for timid Christians! Perhaps, as the angel went
 on his awful mission, the shriek and wail from some neighboring house
 would reach the ears of an Israelitish family. A mother might tremble
 and clasp her child to her breast with fear; her faith might be weak;
 but if the blood were on the door she was safe, though trembling.
 "When I see the blood, I will pass over you." "Pass over." The
 general idea that God was passing through by his destroying angel,
 and left those doors on which the blood was seen. This, perhaps, is
 not strictly the meaning. At least, Bishop Lowth, an eminent Hebrew
 scholar, says, "Two agents are supposed&mdash;the destroying angel on his
 errand of judgment, and Jehovah Himself, as it were, accompanying
 him; and when he sees the sign, 'springing forward before the door,'
 he makes Himself the safety of his own" (compare Isa. xxxi.&nbsp;5).</p>

 <p>Peculiar beauty of the type thus viewed. If the blood of the Lamb is
 sprinkled upon us, we are as safe, though not yet as happy, as the
 redeemed in heaven (Rom. viii.&nbsp;1, 31, 33, 34). Nothing but the blood
 of the great Sacrifice will save the soul. Have you come to it? No
 outward membership, no self-denial, no suffering, nothing but Christ
 can save.</p>

 <p>II. The paschal sacrifice was to be eaten.</p>

 <p>1. The blood was to be sprinkled <i>before</i> the food was eaten. It
 was consciousness of safety through the blood that enabled them with
 gladness to partake of the feast. We must have faith in Jesus before
 we can have communion with him.</p>

 <p>2. It was to be eaten with bitter herbs and unleavened bread&mdash;the
 former the emblem of their bitter oppression and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
 the type of sorrow for sin; the latter showing that the redeemed must
 be holy. They are set free, but it is to be made pure.</p>

 <p>III. The Passover was to be kept.</p>

 <p>The feast of unleavened bread was to last seven days. It was, as it
 were, the continuance of the Passover. The one exhibits the
 <i>way</i> of pardon; the other, the holiness which follows pardon.</p>

 <p>IV. In closing our subject, not exhausting it, turn to Leviticus
 xxiii.&nbsp;9-11.</p>

 <p>1. "On the morrow after the Sabbath," that is, the first day after
 Passover Sabbath, sometimes the third day after the Passover,
 sometimes later.</p>

 <p>2. The sheaf is evidently "Christ the first-fruits" (1&nbsp;Cor. xv.&nbsp;23).
 Jesus rose the third day after the Passover, and this has become our
 Sabbath ever since.</p>

 <p>3. The first sheaf is the pledge of our resurrection&mdash;that is, of our
 declared acceptance and full freedom by our resurrection (1&nbsp;Cor.
 xv.&nbsp;20).</p>

 <p>How full the meaning of the apostle's words, "Christ <i>our</i>
 <i>Passover</i> is sacrificed for us, therefore let us keep the
 feast!" Ours is a greater danger, a nobler deliverance, a higher
 ransom, a grander freedom. Let as live as those who are not their
 own, but are redeemed from "vain conversation" as well as from death
 and condemnation.</p>

THE ART OF SECURING ATTENTION.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capE-157.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVERY one will acknowledge the indispensable
necessity of a teacher's securing good
attention. By attention we mean "fixity of
thought, steadiness of mind."</p>

<p>1. Says Mr. Fitch: "Attention is&mdash;1. An act of the
<i>will</i>. 2. It is <i>the one</i> of all the mental faculties
which is most under our control. Therefore the
degree of attention we give depends upon our disposition,
and is therefore largely a matter of <i>discipline</i>,
and other things being equal, that teacher will
gain the best attention who has most personal influence,
and who is looked up to with the greatest respect."
(Teacher! is your character, conduct, and
manner such as will entitle you to respect?) "3. Attention
is a <i>habit</i>. If truly given, every day it becomes
the easier. And every day we listen languidly
to a lesson or sermon the habit of inattention
is strengthened."</p>

<p>2. Attention is promoted by a deep and earnest
interest in and sympathy with the child, as well as
for him. We must enter into sympathy with him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
so as to understand his nature, his weaknesses, and
his trials, and make all due allowance for them.</p>

<p>3. If the teacher would secure attention, he must
be <i>accurately and abundantly prepared</i>; for no
teacher can teach all he knows, and the moment a
teacher approaches the limit of his preparation, he
shows his weakness and embarrassment, the child
detects it, and he is gone.</p>

<p>4. Improve well the circumstances which surround
the daily life of the child, for you must here gather
your best illustrations. Teachers can do this, if they
are industrious, and will keep their "Sunday-school
spectacles on."</p>

<p>5. Give the children frequent change of posture to
relieve them. Study to do this especially in infant-classes.
Give much freedom of motion and gesture
to the little ones. If they speak of God and heaven,
let them point and look upward in harmony, and
thus teach them in a reverent manner to <i>act out</i> their
words and feelings.</p>

<p>6. Simultaneous reading and making of ellipses,
leaving the children to fill in a word at the close of
the sentence or lesson, will aid in securing attention.</p>

<p>7. Recapitulation is very important to gain the attention.
The scholar must give attention to be prepared
for the expected review. Therefore always
ask in detail, in order to see that all is understood.
No child or man ever takes pains to grasp a subject,
so as to fasten it in his memory, unless he expects to
be called upon for it, or in some way to find use for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
it hereafter. We cannot retain in our minds isolated
or abstract knowledge. Todd beautifully says, "Ask
a child if he knows what whiteness is, and he will
tell you no; ask him if he knows what a white wall
or white paper is, and he knows at once. Ask him
if he knows what hardness is, and he will only stare
at you; but ask him if he knows what a hard wall,
or hard hand, or a hard apple is, and he will tell
you at once." Connect the lesson with previous
knowledge, and take great care to sustain attention
with abundant resources, for if it is once lost, it is
a very difficult thing to regain it on the same lesson.</p>

<p>8. <i>Pictorial</i> power. Word-painting by the aid
of the imagination and ample details; the power
of describing scenes and incidents, so as to appear
real to the child's imagination, will assist you in gaining
his attention. If you will dwell on all the little
details of a fact clearly, you will be graphic in picturing
it out in words; and without these details,
the teacher may sometimes be very graphic with
children, even in the simple act of reading with suitable
<i>emotion</i>, <i>emphasis</i>, and <i>action</i>. Said a little
girl, "Oh, father, Mr. F., the minister, read the 21st
chapter of Revelation in church to-day, and it was
just as if he had taken a pencil and paper and pictured
it right out before us." It is St. John's elegant
description of the Holy City. The Bible makes
great use of the imagination in its numerous emblems,
metaphors, similes, etc. In fact, we cannot worship
God without the aid of the imagination. God is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
compared to a sun and shield; a rock and refuge.
Heaven itself is described with its streets and harps
and crowns of gold, its arches, mansions, rivers, etc.
Even our divine Redeemer calls himself the vine,
the tree, the lamb, the bread, and fountain of living
waters.</p>

<p>9. Avoid a stereotyped or routine mode of teaching.
If ever so good, strive to improve it; vary it,
and freshen it up in some way, and thus keep each
child expecting something.</p>

<p>10. Awaken <i>curiosity</i>. Archbishop Whately says:
"Curiosity is the parent of attention; and a teacher
has no more right to expect success from those who
have no curiosity to learn, than a husbandman has
who sows a field without ploughing it;" duly regard
their love of <i>approbation</i> by cherishing their self-respect;
and if you would retain attention, patiently
cultivate their <i>inquisitiveness</i>, for it will prove one
of the grateful rewards for your kindness. Says an
old writer: "The general occupation of infancy is to
inquire. Education <i>directs</i> their <i>inquiries</i>." Therefore,
bear patiently with your little ones, and answer
all their endless questionings. Do not rashly check
the rising spirit of free inquiry with an impatient
word or frown. Says the poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-center">
<div class="poetry">

   <div class="line quote smaller">"Answer all a child's questions, and ask others as simple</div>
   <div class="line smaller">As its own, yet wisely framed</div>
   <div class="line smaller">To waken and prove the young child's faculties,</div>
   <div class="line smaller">As though its mind was some sweet instrument,</div>
   <div class="line smaller">And you with breath and touch were finding out</div>
   <div class="line smaller">What stops and keys would yield the sweetest music."</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Now, I will freely acknowledge&mdash;1. That attention,
such as we want to get from children, is a very
difficult thing for anybody to give. The incidents of
yesterday and the cares of to-day and business and
pleasures of to-morrow, will divert and scatter attention.
2. That fixed attention to religious subjects is
particularly hard for any one, and <i>especially</i> hard
for children to give; but hard as it is, <i>we must have
it</i>, and no half-hearted, languid attention either, if
we are to do any real good in the Sunday-school.
3. Says an old writer to Sunday-school teachers:
"Let me tell you, you will not get it by claiming it;
by demanding it as a right; or entreating it as a
favor, by urging upon your pupils the importance of
the subject, the sacredness of the day, the kindness
of the teachers, or the great and solemn character of
the truths which you have to impart. All these are
legitimate arguments to be used with older Christians,
but will not do to rely upon with children. Nothing
in the long run&mdash;except fear, which is a very unsatisfactory
motive&mdash;can keep a child's attention fixed but
a sense of <i>real interest</i> in the things which you are
saying. The subject must claim attention for itself,
and therefore, the teacher needs always to be accurately
prepared and well furnished with correct knowledge,
parallel passages, illustrations, facts, anecdotes,
definitions of hard words, allusions, poetry, etc. In
all your teaching, forget not to recall the fresh spirit
of your childhood in all its warmth and earnestness,
remembering that he is the wisest teacher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
who can combine the man's intellect with the child's
heart."</p>

<p>Now it may be, after all, teacher, that your children
may be inattentive, or they will disobey your commands,
or they will fail to treat you with respect;
but if that should be so, we will reply, in conclusion,
in the impressive words of Mr. Fitch: "Ask yourself
in that case whether your own behavior is uniform
and dignified; whether you ever give commands
without seeing that they are obeyed; whether you
waste your words or your influence in an injudicious
way; whether there is anything in your conduct that
reveals to the children a want of punctuality or order,
or of earnestness or steadfastness on your part? For
children are very keen observers of character, and,
in the long run, are sure to feel loyalty and affection
for one who is manifestly anxious to do them good,
and who can be uniformly relied on in word and in
deed."</p>

<h2>XVIII.<br />
THE ART OF QUESTIONING.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is a real <i>art</i> in knowing where,
when, and how to put a good question, that
shall quicken the memory, set the mind to
thinking, and call back the reflective faculties. Such
are the possibilities of a question. A large proportion
of all the good teaching in our Sabbath-schools
is brought about by the simple process of questions
and answers. "A question unveils the soul. Nothing
can escape a question. A question reveals
decision." Hence the skill required. Mr. J. G.
Fitch says: "The success and efficiency of our
teaching depend more on the skill and judgment
with which we put questions than on any other
single circumstance."</p>

<p>This art is to be learned, like any other art, by
much study and patient practice, for we best learn
the art of questioning <i>by questioning</i>. Augustine
says: "A boy can preach, but a man only can catechise,"
and Lord Bacon says: "A wise question is
the half of knowledge." Therefore the great skill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
in teaching consists mainly in the right forming and
asking of questions.</p>

<p>If this be true, it follows that this subject should be
regarded as of special importance by every teacher.
Teachers often say that they cannot succeed in asking
questions without the book; that they do not
know what to ask. To this I reply, 1. There is never
any difficulty in forming the question where there is
an interest to obtain the answer. 2. It is generally
unwise to ask any question unless we have an interest
in obtaining the answer. Do not tantalize the little
ones. Says Mr. Hassell: "A question under some circumstances
will merely produce an exercise of the
memory; under others an exercise of reasoning;
and under others again it will stimulate inquiry,"
and we may add, awaken curiosity. Mr. Groser
says: "The true scope of questioning-power is as
follows: To awaken curiosity or the desire to know;
to arouse the memory or the recollection of what is
already known; or to point out something unknown,
which may be inferred from that which is known."
A question skillfully put will arouse, will fix attention,
concentrate the thoughts, and so discipline the
mind of the pupil.</p>

<p>There are, however, many bad and indifferent questions
put, in religious teaching, which a little knowledge
of the correct rules of the art of questioning
will enable us to avoid. Frequently a slight variation
in the form changes a bad question into a good
one. For instance: "Moses was a good man, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
he not?" is a bad question. "What kind of a man
was Moses?" is a good question, as it awakens
thought. "What do you understand by faith and
repentance?" is a bad question, for it is ambiguous
and indefinite, and perplexes the child. "Will you
tell me what is faith?" is a good question, for it
compels the child to think and to inquire&mdash;it puts
into his hand the laboring oar and he must row.
"Did David kill Goliath with a stone or with a
sword?" This is a bad question. It is involved and
suggestive. Ask the child simply, "With what did
David kill Goliath?" and the question is a good one,
in strict conformity with the laws of questioning and
of the child-mind.</p>

<p>Another class of questions is very common, but
well nigh useless, namely, leading questions, such
as, "Was David a good man?" "Was Goliath a
wicked man?" These are mostly bad or indifferent
questions, and are almost a total loss to the teacher.
Slightly vary them in the following way, and you
make them at once, in every aspect, good questions.
"What kind of a man was David?" "What kind
of a man was Goliath?" Teachers will remember,
therefore, to avoid ambiguous or indefinite, involved
or suggestive, and leading questions, which latter are
answered "Yes" or "No," for they are generally of
little avail.</p>

<p>What kind of questions, then, shall Sabbath-school
teachers seek to use? I reply:</p>

<p>1. Questions of <i>Examination</i>, in order to find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
out what the pupil already knows; to gauge his
present knowledge, and ascertain what he needs to
know.</p>

<p>2. Questions of <i>explanation</i> of particular words,
which should be put freely while reading the
lesson.</p>

<p>3. Questions of <i>actual instruction</i>, or reflective
questions, thus making the pupil teach himself, or
find out as much as possible by thinking and inquiring,
and thus leading him to correct his own answers.
Much instruction may be communicated by asking
questions and correcting the answers, but great care
should be taken to make the most of the answers,
and to do full justice to them. Socrates's plan was
to lead the pupil by a pleasant question to discover
his own error, instead of directly charging him with
it. Encourage your scholars by all means to ask
questions with freedom, and give your teaching more
the form of an earnest conversation.</p>

<p>4. Questions of <i>recapitulation</i> or review. In
this way you ascertain whether your lessons are
received, for the test is their telling it back to you in
their own language. You question the lesson <i>into</i>
the minds of the scholars, and then question it <i>out</i>
again. Herbert, in his "Country Parson," gives us
an illustration. After asking, "Since man is so miserable,
what is to be done?" and the answerer could
not tell, instead of telling him, he properly asked
the following simple question, "What would he
do if he were in a ditch?" This familiar illustration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
made the answer so plain that he was even
ashamed of his ignorance; for he could not but say,
"He would make haste out of it as fast as he could."
Then he proceeded to ask whether he could get out
of the ditch alone or whether he needed a helper,
and who was that helper? This is the skill; and
doubtless the Holy Scripture intends thus much when
it condescends to the naming of a plough, leaven,
boys piping and dancing, showing that ordinary
things are to be washed and cleansed, and serve as
lights for heavenly truths.</p>

<p>5. Questions with an <i>ellipsis</i> are most useful in the
review or summing up of the lesson, as, "He says,
I am the good&mdash;<i>Shepherd</i>. Come unto&mdash;<i>me</i>," etc.</p>

<p>6. Questions may often be used to kindle the
reflective faculties, to exercise the mind and to
develope ideas.</p>

<p>7. And, lastly, questions <i>applying</i> divine truth&mdash;softly,
thoughtfully, and in a few words&mdash;should
never be forgotten. Jesus did so and so. "<i>Do you?</i>"
David said, "Oh how love I thy law?" "<i>Do you
so love it?</i>" Solomon said, "Remember now thy
Creator." Charlie, "<i>Do you love to remember your
Creator?</i>" or "<i>Why not?</i>" etc.</p>

<p>Not only are the character and adaptation of the
question of great importance, but the manner and
look of the eye and the tone of voice and the manner
of receiving the answer. The manner should
be kind, gentle, life-like, and winning; the look of
the eye should beam with life and interest, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
tone of voice should bespeak great tenderness and
sympathy. A cold, formal tone of voice will repel
the answer, even with a good question. It should be
sprightly, and respectfully familiar and natural.
Children cannot endure coldness nor dullness nor
dryness; therefore avoid all long pauses and sluggish
manner and heavy voice. The way which you receive
the answers will determine the question whether
your scholars will freely answer you or not. Make
the most of an answer unless it is absolutely wrong,
and if wrong, say, "Will some scholar tell me why
that answer is wrong?" Search out for all the points
or hints of truth you can find in the answer of the
child, and unfold it and hold it up in the most favorable
and gracious light.</p>

<p>Never snap up a scholar, or neglect or ridicule his
answers, however faulty. Always be candid and
sincere, and your scholars will soon learn to trust
themselves with you. A sharp, harsh reply will
close the lips of a whole class. Enunciate every word
with clearness. Vary the questions with all patience
if not answered readily, and never think a child does
not know because he does not answer the question
at once. Be sure "never to tell a child what you
could make that child tell you."</p>

<p>Let your questions have a regular connection, so
that one will naturally follow another, and in fact,
glide into the next, and "say as little as you can in
questioning and teaching, but so say it as to cause
the children to say as much as possible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Then again be careful to adapt your questions
well. Do not tell much in your questions. Put the
right question to the right scholar, for it will not do
to ask A or B or C a question which only D in
the class can answer, for we are not to ask any child
any question unless we suppose the answer is in the
mind of the child.</p>

<p>It is of particular importance that in the commencement
of a lesson we always start aright. Have
some easy, pleasant questions ready, which they will
be glad to answer. No matter what occurs, never
manifest impatience or severity, or descend to a
witticism or a sneer. A sneering, sarcastic teacher
should be left out of the school. Therefore gladly
receive and develope, in the most charitable manner,
the half-uttered, stammering answer of the child at
your feet, and your children, in their hearts, will
bless you.</p>

<p>Dr. Arnold, the great teacher at Rugby, said:
"It was his practice to teach by questioning, and
as a general rule, he never gave information except
as a kind of reward for an answer. His explanations
were as short as possible, and his questions were of
a kind to call the attention of the boys to the real
point of every subject, and to disclose to them the
exact boundaries of what they knew and what they
did not know." Let me add to this Archdeacon
Bather's account of how he became a catechist. He
says in his "Hints on Catechising:"</p>

<p>"Perhaps, gentle reader, before I actually enter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
upon my task of teaching you to teach others by
catechising, it may be as well to tell you how I became
a catechist myself; for the thought seized upon
me and occupied me much in very early life. I was
at school at Rugby, and at the time I speak of, was
in what we called the '<i>upper third</i>.' The '<i>upper
fourth</i>' was under the care of Mr. Innes, afterwards
Head Master of the Royal Free Grammar School
at Warwick. As I was sitting one evening in the
room of my private tutor, Mr. Homer, some one
knocked at the door, and in came Mr. Innes.
'Bather,' says he, 'when Mr. Homer has done with
you, will you come up into my room? I want to
speak to you; you will find nobody there but O&mdash;&mdash;
(naming one of my school-fellows) and myself.' Of
course I went; and Mr. Innes, motioning my companion
to a chair and myself to another, took his
own and addressed us thus: 'I am going to set you
two boys very hard at work. Pray, O&mdash;&mdash;, do you
know anything about astronomy?' 'Not much, I
am afraid, sir.' 'And you, Bather?' 'Not so much
as O&mdash;&mdash;, I am afraid.' 'Well, now, do not flatter
yourselves that I am going to tell you anything about
it, for I shall do no such thing. Nevertheless, you
shall know more about it, and a good deal, too,
before you go out of this room.' He then put questions
to us both, by which he soon elicited all the
particulars of such little knowledge as we possessed;
and then he questioned us further, soon causing us
to make many blunders, and then making us correct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
our answers, so that we certainly did quit the room
with fuller and more orderly notions of the matter
than we brought into it." He says, although this
did not make him an astronomer, yet it led him to
think and discern what must be the most effectual
way of imparting knowledge, for "under Mr. Innes
his interest never flagged; he could have listened all
night."</p>

<p>From the same source is here added another illustration
of teaching by the means of leading questions.
"Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the
wilderness," etc. "Then was Jesus." What do
you mean by "then was Jesus?" (Hesitates.)
"Then took Mary a pound of ointment." What
do you mean by "then took Mary?" Then Mary
took. What do you mean by "then was Jesus?"
and the answer came readily, "Then Jesus was."
Now you shall question me. Put me a question to
which each clause shall be a reply, beginning with
the first. "When was Jesus led up to be tempted?"
"Then." So here you are taught&mdash;what? The
time when these things took place. Put me a question
to which the words "led up" shall be an answer.
"What was done to Jesus?" He was "led up."
Put a question for the word "Spirit." "Who led
him up?" "The Spirit." So of the word "wilderness."
"Whither did the Spirit lead him?" "Into
the wilderness."</p>

<p>Let us add one more illustration, showing how to
put questions to help and lead. The manner must,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of course, be right, for a clumsy method will hinder
rather than help, and if we expect a right answer
the question must be a simple one, or one that will
not admit of being put as <i>two</i> questions. The following
anecdote may serve as the illustration: "A
lady came one day to my school and requested me
to let her hear the children catechised. The class happened
to be reading the third chapter of the Acts, the
first of which reads thus: 'Now Peter and John went
up together into the temple at the hour of prayer,
being the ninth hour.' 'Well,' I said to the teacher,
'stop there and question them on that verse.' 'At
what time of day?' said he, 'did those things take
place which are here set down?' 'At the ninth
hour,' replied the class. But then a poor boy became
a little frightened at something or other, and consequently
puzzled; and after some hesitation said,
'Well, then, at the ninth hour, <i>who went where?</i>'
The first boy in the class smiled a little, but made no
answer; the next seemed to think a little, but still no
voice came. I took care that nobody should answer
out of his turn, and the question was put to every
boy severally to the bottom of the class. The lady
turned to me and expressed her surprise that out of
a class of five-and-twenty boys nobody could answer.
'Well, ma'am, I am afraid you will consider these
five-and-twenty boys very stupid, but let us look a
little further into the matter.' And then, turning
round, my eye caught that of Jack Thompson.
'Jack,' said I, 'how many stupid boys have we got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in our second class?' 'One, sir,' says Jack. 'And
who may he be?' 'The teacher, sir.' 'You must
prove your words, Jack: come and teach the class
yourself.' Now Jack was not an impudent boy; but
as he advanced and saw the lady looking at him, he
did not appear so confused as poor Peter had done
before, and he betook himself at once to business.
'You have told us,' said he, 'that the things related
in this verse took place at the ninth hour of the day;
to what was that hour wont to be devoted?' 'To
prayer.' 'And what was the building called that was
open, at that time, to receive the worshippers?' 'The
temple.' 'Are not some persons specially mentioned
who came to the temple at that time?' 'Yes.' 'How
many?' 'Two.' 'What were their names?' 'Peter
and John.' 'Where did Peter and John go at the
ninth hour?' 'Into the temple.' 'What for?' 'To
pray,' etc. The lady began to perceive that the
children did know something about the matter, and
Jack Thompson, being concerned for the conduct of
his class, proceeded to ask them a great many more
questions, to which the answers were very satisfactory.
The lady good-humoredly expressed her
approval, and I said, 'Now, madam, you see that all
that was the matter was, that poor Peter, being a
little confused, put his questions in a clumsy manner.
Depend upon it, he will not soon do the like again.'"</p>

<p>Questions should be progressive, that is, they should
proceed from the simple and the known to the faintly
known, and thence to the unknown.</p>

<h2>XIX.<br />
THE TEACHERS' MEETING.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capA-174.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A REGULAR weekly meeting of Sabbath-school
teachers for conference and prayer
about all school matters, and a mutual contribution
of thoughts and illustrations and plans of
teaching adapted to each and to all the various
classes on the next Sabbath's lesson, is now considered
an indispensable necessity. And it is a great
social and religious privilege as well.</p>

<p>We are all unworthy, and need to learn how to
teach Scripture truths attractively to youthful minds.
All need training for the work, and the weekly
teachers' meetings ought to be the grand normal
training-schools for Sabbath-school teachers everywhere.
Every Sabbath-school ought also to have
a Bible-class or two for the training of teachers. The
almost half a million of Sabbath-school teachers in
our land&mdash;the <i>masses</i>&mdash;cannot mingle with us in
council in our great Conventions and Institutes, and
consequently the few favored ones must imbibe the
spirit and avail themselves of ample materials, and
carry it down to the quiet, devoted workers in common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Sabbath-schools through the means of a well-ordered
teachers' meeting. The meeting can be
held for one hour and a half on a week-day evening
at the lecture-room, or, better yet, at the superintendent's
house or that of one of the teachers, alternately.
It is conducted usually by the superintendent, but
sometimes by the pastor, or by one of the teachers
who can sustain the interest.</p>

<p>But we are met at this point with a stubborn and
overwhelming fact, viz.: a large proportion of all
these meetings attempted to be held have resulted
in a failure, and have been abandoned, so that now
in some places not one school in ten or twenty holds
such a meeting. With such an experience we can
never ask Sabbath-school teachers to try the experiment
on the old plan. We must count the cost, and
Sabbath-school men, with only an hour or two in a
week for it, cannot afford to make mistakes or
failures. Time is too precious.</p>

<p>The great practical question arises, What are the
causes of failure? Is it anything inherent in these
meetings? or is it in the wrong mode of conducting
them? After a most careful investigation of the
subject, especially during the last fifteen or twenty
years, I have come to the deliberate conclusion that
it is owing almost entirely to the wrong plans on
which they are conducted. What have been these
wrong plans?</p>

<p>1st. They have ordinarily been conducted on the
Bible-class, question-book, commentary-studying, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
theological-discussing plans; and on those plans they
have, and will, in at least nine cases out of ten, result
in failure, whether in the hands of pastors or of
superintendents. Teachers do not gain enough in
such meetings to reward them for their time and
trouble in coming, and consequently they cannot be
censured for non-attendance.</p>

<p>2d. Another plan of conducting them is in the
form of lectures. But on this plan not even an expository
lecture has prevented the meeting from being
a failure. Occasionally a pastor or a superintendent,
with great expository powers and a sprightly
manner of analyzing truth and a personal sympathy
with the teachers and children, can sustain and make
these meetings interesting and profitable on this
plan, and to such we can say&mdash;God bless you&mdash;<i>go
on</i>! But we cannot afford to recommend any plan
for general adoption with such a prospect of failure.</p>

<p>What, then, must be done? We say decidedly,
<i>revolutionize your plans</i>, and meet with the direct
aim and purpose of <i>helping one another</i> in your
work, and especially on the next Sabbath's lesson.</p>

<p>What then are the objects of teachers' meetings,
and how should they be conducted? The objects
appear to me to be&mdash;1. To get all the teachers
well acquainted, socially and religiously, and as
teachers. 2. To combine our mutual confidences,
sympathies and prayers. 3. To mutually help each
other and relieve each other's difficulties by conferring
together on such questions as&mdash;how best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to secure and retain attention;&mdash;how to question;&mdash;how
to prepare the lesson and present it, and
teach it;&mdash;how to draw lessons of instruction, illustrate
and apply truth;&mdash;how to analyze the lesson,
lay out the plan of it, and break it up into small,
convenient parcels, adapted to all capacities from
the infant up to the adult classes;&mdash;how to make
the Word of God most useful, most interesting and
most impressive to youthful minds, convicting of
sin and converting to God; and the thorough training
of the young in the Christian life, and in the sound
knowledge of revealed truth.</p>

<p>The way to conduct these meetings is, to go to
work naturally, systematically and directly, in a common-sense
way, to accomplish these grand objects.
Suppose, after singing two verses of an appropriate
hymn, a direct prayer of two or three minutes, and
one verse of Scripture that just meets the case, the
leader inquires for the next half hour the size, regularity,
etc., of the different classes, and asks counsel
to correct irregularities. In this way the teachers
will become so well acquainted with each other's
classes that they can intelligently pray for each other.
Then have a recess of ten or fifteen minutes for introduction
and social intercourse; after which another
half hour should be devoted to inquiring of
each teacher for the various <i>best thoughts</i> of the
lesson for them to use. Let the next meeting be
directed to the difficulties, and how to relieve them,
and the last half hour to asking for illustrations for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the week or month's lesson. At the next meeting
inquire, Have you <i>visited</i> your scholars during the
month, and what have you found of interest in your
visits? Then devote the last half hour to examples
and <i>plans of teaching</i> different verses by several
teachers. At the fourth and last meeting of the
month inquire, Is there any special religious interest
in your class? or, Why not? and lastly, How can you
<i>apply</i> the lesson so as best to make a saving impression?</p>

<p>In some such way I would meet real present wants,
avoiding routine, and providing something fresh and
varied at every meeting, just adapted to all. In some
such way conduct your meetings, and no teacher can
afford to be absent.</p>

<p>In a country school district Sabbath-school let the
teachers turn all their sociability into this channel, and
set apart, say Thursday evening of each week, for a
pleasant social teachers' meeting at the residence of
the superintendent or one of the teachers, alternating
about. Let the farmers arrange to leave their work
an hour earlier on that evening for the sake of the
great blessing to their children. Provide attendants
for the lady teachers. Suppose the superintendent
lives one mile north of the school-house, and two
teachers are one mile east, three south, and four west.
The two young lady teachers "one mile east" have
no escort, but the superintendent remembers that in
the next house further east, the only son of Esquire
Jones, a fine young man of sixteen years, has just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
drifted out of the Sabbath-school, and is inclining
toward fast horses and gay companions. The superintendent
yearns to reach and save him. He thinks
and prays over the matter until he feels deeply for
the youth. He then visits him, and approaches him
with unusual respect&mdash;informs him that he has come
to ask a particular favor&mdash;will he accept the post of
librarian in our flourishing little Sabbath-school?
He readily consents. The superintendent then says,
"Charlie, we teachers have a delightful social gathering
at each other's houses every Thursday evening,
and as you have a fine horse and buggy, cannot you
make it convenient to bring up the two Misses S&mdash;&mdash;
to that meeting?" Why, of course, it is just what the
superintendent wants, and it is also just what Charlie
wants&mdash;something to do, and soon, by God's grace,
Charlie becomes a true Christian.</p>

<p>In whatever form the teachers' meetings are conducted
it is indispensable&mdash;1. That the conductor
feels a sincere respect for each teacher, and treats
his opinions with candor. 2. That the conductor
shall adapt his questions to each individual, and ask
those questions with real courtesy and consideration.
3. It is absolutely necessary that the conductor should
receive all replies in a life-like manner, with due respect,
and make the best of them. If the answers
are not well received, it will close the lips of the
teachers. They must draw together, and a dull, prosy
conductor will check them all.</p>

<p>There is great value in the combined counsels and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
experience of almost any common band of teachers
if fairly and fully drawn out. It will often be seen
that "the commonest mind has thoughts worthy of
the rarest." In this way the teachers' meetings can
be sustained in the hands of ordinary superintendents,
and will become the most attractive gatherings in the
whole community. An accomplished young lady
said to me: "One such meeting as this is worth
more than a dozen costly New York parties." The
teachers will regularly attend, for they need the
assistance which can here be obtained. As well ask
a brakeman to run a locomotive, or a spinner to
superintend a factory, or an untaught man to teach
an academy, as to ask an inexperienced person, or
even a classical scholar, to teach divine truth when
no one has taught him how. James Gall says, most
truly, "Education is the highest of all the sciences,
and teaching the most important of all the arts."
Teachers then, need training, and the teachers'
meeting can be made one of the most valuable means
of securing it. One of the great objects of Sabbath-School
Teachers' Institutes is to train superintendents,
teachers, etc., so that they can interestingly and profitably
conduct their weekly teachers' meetings, which
are the real institutes for the great mass of teachers.</p>

<div class="small">

<h3><i>Examples.</i></h3>

<p>The following Examples are real, as taken from
my note-book during the present year:</p>

 <p>I. At one time the lesson was the parable of the Prodigal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
 Son. The first teacher was called up for the best thought for his
 class in the lesson. He replied, "Like the prodigal, all children
 want to have their own way." The second teacher, "The farther he
 wandered the greater his misery." The third, "When <i>starving</i>,
 came to himself." 4. He resolved to "arise and go to his father." 5.
 "He <i>returned</i>." 6. "After his father fell on his neck, he
 <i>confessed</i>." 7. "His confidence in his father when he
 returned." 8. "His father saw him a <i>great way off</i>." 9. "Father
 <i>ran</i>,"&mdash;old men do not usually run. 10. "With joy
 <i>embraced</i> and kissed him," etc.&nbsp;11. "The degradation of a
 sinful course." 12. The father's wonderful condescension and
 willingness.</p>

 <p>II. At another teachers' meeting the lesson was Luke xviii.&nbsp;18-27.
 The Young Ruler.&mdash;First, prayer, singing, and reading of the lesson.
 Then called on the teachers for their plan of teaching the lesson.</p>

 <p>The <i>First Teacher</i> gave five heads. 1. Question, "What shall I
 do?" 2. Knowing the law. 3. Taking up the cross. 4. Rejecting the
 cross. 5. The great obstacle.</p>

 <p><i>Second Teacher.</i>&mdash;1. Eternal life, what is it? 2. Have you kept
 the law? 3. What else was required? 4. Come. 5. Overcome every
 obstacle. 6. You must love nothing better than Christ.</p>

 <p><i>Third Teacher's</i> plan was&mdash;The Young Ruler was, 1. Rich; 2.
 Pleasing; 3. Respectful; 4. Ready to learn; 5. Prostrate&mdash;the custom
 of the country; 6. Put first his love to neighbors; 7.
 Commandments&mdash;Pharisee. Show the children how far they can go and yet
 be lost. He was a church member, an officer in the church, a ruler:
 he came to Jesus prostrate, prayed respectfully&mdash;Jesus applied the
 touchstone and <i>all</i> was <i>wanting</i>.</p>

 <p><i>Fourth Teacher.</i>&mdash;1. Young man's great desire. 2. It was to be
 saved. 3. Go to God's word. 4. Justified himself. 5. He loved money
 more than he loved God. 6. Hollow-hearted. Study the scholar as much
 as the lesson.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
 <i>Fifth Teacher.</i>&mdash;1. Young man's question and manner. 2.
 Asserting he kept all the law. 3. He thought himself honest and
 sincere, but was deceived. 4. Wanted satisfying peace. 5. Not willing
 to remove his idols. 6. Great ignorance of the young man. 7. Riches a
 great hindrance. 8. See our Lord's firmness.</p>

 <p><i>Sixth Teacher.</i>&mdash;We must show our love to Christ by love to our
 neighbors.</p>

 <p><i>Seventh Teacher.</i>&mdash;With man it is impossible, but not with God.</p>

 <p><i>Eighth Teacher.</i>&mdash;Something must be given up for Christ. What?
 Pride, sloth, ill-temper, bad company, bad books, love of dress,
 pleasure.&mdash;See Abraham going to a strange land. Offering Isaac, etc.</p>

 <p><i>Ninth Teacher.</i>&mdash;Ruler had his ideas of <i>doing</i> something
 to gain heaven, and was at work for it. The great Teacher took him on
 his own ground and <i>convicted</i> him of <i>sin</i>.</p>

 <p><i>Tenth Teacher.</i>&mdash;A child says: "Why, here is an honest, sincere
 seeker, who went to Jesus in the right manner and way, but failed."
 How hard to be saved! But see&mdash;1. His question. 2. The Saviour's
 answer. 3. The obstacles and hindrances. 4. The greatest apparent
 defect is in the second table of the law. If perfectly convicted, why
 so confident? etc.</p>

 <p>III. Lesson, Matthew viii.&nbsp;1-4. Have eight distinct exercises. 1.
 Read the lesson. 2. Catechise or question upon it. 3. The numerical
 exercise or asking, How many things, etc.&nbsp;4. <i>Explanations</i> and
 illustrations of difficult words. 5. Draw out great important
 <i>thoughts</i> of the lesson. 6. Call forth the <i>lessons</i> of
 instruction. 7. Make the <i>application</i> to heart and life. 8.
 Review of the whole; and then, if desired, two more exercises can be
 added by turning the lesson into <i>prayer</i>, and next to a
 <i>paraphrase</i> formed of the verses.</p>

 <p>There are <i>three</i> kinds of teaching. 1. Catechising or
 questioning. 2. Conversational.&nbsp;3. Lecturing. Which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
 yours? We might add a fourth; but that is not teaching at all, only
 it is sometimes called so&mdash;viz., Reading questions from a
 question-book, and reading the answers. Good teaching is earnest,
 hearty work.</p>

 <p>IV. The fourth and last example is of the social form of teachers'
 meeting. I give the notes of one held on the evening of December 11,
 1867. We met at 6 o'clock P.M., precisely, at the house of Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;;
 opened with singing and prayer. Then had half an hour's studying of
 the lesson, which was upon the Atonement. Some of the thoughts drawn
 out were: Mediation,&mdash;arbitration,&mdash;the God-man,&mdash;dead goat and the
 goat sent away,&mdash;the passover,&mdash;the victim,&mdash;a substitute,&mdash;altar,
 victim, shed blood; vivid picture of offering the lamb;&mdash;atonement
 looks both ways;&mdash;blood cleanseth. How do you get the atonement? Have
 you got it? How do you prove gratitude to God for it? Exalting the
 great truth, "Christ died for me." He is the only barrier against
 eternal death. The lesson was shown in three phases: 1. The Redeemer
 buys us from sin&mdash;is our ransom; 2. Saves us from sin; 3. Reconciles
 us to God. Take first under three heads: 1. Man is a ruined wanderer;
 2. Man a captive; 3. Man is free in Christ and saved. After the
 lesson was thus considered, the next half hour was devoted to
 <i>business</i>. The library, Christmas exercises, singing, and
 length of opening exercises, and the treasury, were topics. The next
 hour was given to tea and social intercourse. The last hour was
 devoted to accounts of interesting or discouraging things in the
 teachers' classes, and work, and intermingled with frequent prayer
 and singing. All was conducted spiritually and in earnest, and it was
 a precious three hours.</p>

VISITING THE SCHOLARS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capE-157.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVERY Sabbath-school teacher should regularly
visit his scholars once a month, and
every Sabbath-school superintendent should
visit his teachers regularly once in three months.
These are very important and yet too often neglected
duties. A superintendent can hardly discharge his
duties to the teachers without frequently visiting them.
This should be no mere formal visit. It should be a
Christian conference about all the details, particularly
of their classes and their duties. The superintendent
is the regular counsellor and guide of the teachers.
He should talk about their teaching, about each and
all their scholars, their difficulties, their trials and
successes, and aid and encourage them by every
means. These visits should be made so cheerful and
pleasant, so free from fault-finding and complaint,
that the teachers will hail them with great joy.</p>

<p>The Sabbath-school teacher also, from his own necessities
and from duty, must needs visit his scholars
often. He has a real errand to the home of every
child. He can snatch intervals of time going to or returning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
from business. He cannot teach that child
aright and to good advantage unless he is well
acquainted with all his home influences; with all
there is in the child's surroundings to help or hinder
the teacher's work; with all the dangers, temptations,
and trials of the child's everyday life; with
all the characteristics of parents and friends. It is
from the vicinity of these homes that the teacher
will be enabled to see and hear things that will
furnish him with good illustrations. He can obtain
the parents' co-operation and friendship, and have
personal interviews and gain the child's spiritual
confidence in these visits to its home and fireside
circle. "My teacher has come to see <i>me</i>," is often
the joyful utterance of the grateful little ones.</p>

<p>Sabbath-school teachers should never neglect this
privilege, neither should they make careless or indifferent
visits. Arouse up and think your visit all
out beforehand. Think what in substance you are
going to talk about, what you ought to say, so as to
make your visit as welcome and as profitable as possible
both to parents and scholars. Have an errand
to every house. Carry some little book or tract or
paper, if convenient. Give them some interesting
and valuable information, or make earnest inquiries
and give good wishes and prayers for rich blessings,
temporal and spiritual. Choose the right time and
seek favorable opportunities. Absentees must, of
course, be visited without delay, for it may be sickness
has detained them. "The sickness of a child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
is a golden opportunity for the teacher; God himself
ploughs the ground and he must not withhold the
seed." Especially avail yourself of seasons when
the heart is made tender by illness, afflictions, and
trials. Then be constant and true, for it may be your
harvest-time of souls. "Oh, to be the guiding star
of such a little circle is one of the highest privileges
of earth." Teacher, may that privilege and blessing
be yours.</p>

<p>We add a single illustrative example from
"<i>The Teacher Teaching</i>:"</p>

<div class="small">

 <p class="small">A decently-dressed woman calls at your house and begs for a shawl to
 protect a neighbor of hers from the cold when she goes out to her
 daily work. You have a shawl. You have laid it aside for this very
 purpose. Why not give it to her and have done with it? If you do not
 know the person who calls, it would be very injudicious to entrust to
 a stranger what you intended for a third person. It may be pawned for
 strong drink, or retained by one who is not in want. Better go or
 send and satisfy yourself that the need exists, and see that it is
 supplied. You wisely conclude to look for yourself. You find the
 object of your charity, and ascertain that she is a superior
 needle-woman, capable of earning her living, but not able to find
 work where there is none. If she could hire a room in some part of
 the city nearer the demand for work, she might succeed. You give her
 the shawl, and with it a few words of encouragement. In a day or two
 you are at a meeting of the directors of the Industrial Home or
 Orphans' Society, and allude to the case of this woman. A young lady
 present immediately recollects a poor woman, whom she has seen during
 the week, who has a room to rent, and perhaps it would exactly suit.
 The parties are brought together and the room is taken. Two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
 wants are thus promptly supplied&mdash;the want of a <i>room</i> and the
 want of a <i>tenant</i>. But how came the young lady to know of such
 a room? Why, simply by visiting the mother of one of her class in the
 Sunday-school. It was not any part of her plan to obtain any such
 information; nor could she have known that it might be of any
 advantage to her or to any one else for her to possess it. The
 indirect result of this simple visit accomplished&mdash;what? 1. It
 secured a tenant for a vacant room, and thus helped a poor woman to
 pay her rent. 2. It put another poor woman in a comfortable and
 convenient position to earn her own living. 3. It laid the mother of
 one of her Sunday-school children under great obligation to her, and
 thus increased her influence and her power to do good both to mother
 and child. It will take a strong force to sunder that tie. 4. It
 brought to the new tenant Christian care and sympathy, which she
 before lacked, and the way for her attendance on the stated means of
 grace."</p>

</div>

<p>Thus is exemplified, by a single real and comparatively
unimportant incident in humble life, the
power of the Sunday-school machinery, in its legitimate
movements, to improve and elevate social condition
and character. It was all the work of that
little wheel in our machinery called <span class="smcap">Visiting</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <img width="400" height="66" alt="" src="images/ill-005.jpg" />

<h2>XXI.<br />
SYSTEMATIC DISTRICT CHRISTIAN VISITATION.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE plan here given in its present form grew
out of an exigency in the operations of the
Missionary Committee of the New York
Sunday-School Union in the summer of 1856.</p>

<p>In their great endeavor to reach the neglected
masses of children and youth, more than sixty thousand
seemed to be beyond their reach. A more
<i>thorough</i> work was needed. Occasional visits and
ordinary attention did not so gain the acquaintance
and confidence as to rescue these neglected ones.
They were the most destitute and needy, and the
most important to reach in our city. After much
consideration and prayer, this plan was adopted,
presented to, and accepted by the churches in New
York and Brooklyn, and it was soon adopted by
other cities and States also. Everywhere it has
developed astonishing results, increasing Sabbath-schools
and churches, and speedily transforming dark
neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Forty-four churches of various evangelical denominations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
entered upon the work within a few months
after its introduction, and quite uniformly the Sabbath-schools
<i>doubled</i> their scholars within the first
month or two, and in some marked instances church
members and congregations were more than doubled
in numbers within six months. As long as it was
faithfully worked it everywhere prospered, demonstrating
that the plan was a good one.</p>

<p>It is based on the great command, "<i>Go ye and
teach</i>." It believes that every church-member should
be a working Christian, a real missionary; that
"every man should <i>speak to his neighbor, and each
one to his brother</i>;" that every Christian's business
should be so arranged as to give a wider scope for his
religion, that he may become, in a degree, a voluntary
missionary. It proposes to <i>systematize</i> the work.
Mere voluntary personal effort is at times so fitful
and evanescent as not to be sufficiently reliable.</p>

<p>The plan is for every church to take a definite
district as its special missionary field&mdash;in the city
a certain number of blocks and streets, and in the
country a number of miles square, or neighborhoods,
properly arranged so as to give every other church
a portion of the field to work.</p>

<p>All this is to be subdivided by a committee of the
church into small sub-sections of from five to fifteen
families, proportionate to the number of able members.
A sub-section is assigned to the member, and
becomes his or her little parish, on which to bestow
especial labor, sympathy, and prayers. He is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
visit it every month, invite all the children to some
Sunday-school, the family to church, supply with the
Bible, tract, etc., and do all possible temporal and
spiritual good. Once a month each church devotes
one of the weekly prayer-meetings to hearing reports
from the visitors, and conferring and praying over
this great work. Special care is taken not to proselyte;
not to take a child from one school to another,
or induce a person to leave one church for another,
but to respect the rights of all. Individuals are not
considered under any obligations to <i>confine</i> their
visits to their assigned districts, but still enjoy the
Christian liberty of going everywhere and doing good
to all men as they have opportunity.</p>

<p>This work is&mdash;1. A holy work. 2. A deliberate
work. 3. It is a work of pure good-will.&nbsp;4. Says
Rev. Dr. Chalmers: "No other ministration is to be
offered than that of respect and kindness." 5. They
are to go just so far "as they will be gratefully met
by the population." 6. Visit rich and poor, but
carefully select districts adapted to the visitors.
7. Seek the confidence of parents and children; be
patient, be persevering, be courageous, be sympathetic,
and take no notice of repulses. 8. Enter no
house in vain. Leave some kind suggestion, counsel,
or sympathy in regard to spiritual or temporal interests.
9. Relieve all want and distress possible;
inculcate temperance, cleanliness, and economy.
10. Counsel with mothers with reference to their
children. 11. Give a fraternal aspect to your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
visits, and avoid controversy, and generally even
argument.</p>

<p>If each professing Christian in our churches who
is able would become responsible for the regular
visitation of but four neglected families, every family
in our land would be faithfully visited. "What a
plain, simple, magnificent idea is here presented!"
A regular Christian army of occupation for our whole
country. Says the Rev. Dr. Guthrie: "It would
everywhere bring life into contact with death, and
cover the whole outlying population, even as the
prophet with his own body covered the dead body
of the child." The motto is: <span class="smcap">Every child in
the Sabbath-school, and every family in the
Church</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<h2>XXII.<br />
NEW MISSION-SCHOOLS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capI-007.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN all our great cities, in the town and country,
there are vast numbers of immortal
youth far beyond the reach of churches
and church Sabbath-schools, and therefore, it becomes
necessary to carry the Sunday-school to them.
A room is obtained, conveniently located, with seats,
books, etc. The children are gathered, taught to
read, to sing, to pray, presented with library books,
papers, etc., and thus innumerable blessings are sent
down into destitute families, and soon, like leaven,
the Gospel is seen diffusing itself everywhere among
the mass.</p>

<p>Something like seventy of these mission-schools
are now successfully sustained in New York City
alone, with twelve to fifteen thousand pupils in them.
Roman Catholic, Jewish, and other classes of children
are in this way easily and successfully reached, and
permanently benefited. This instrumentality must
be largely increased everywhere. Some five or six
different denominations often unite in the labors of
one of these schools, and all work together in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
most beautiful harmony. This movement is in the
highest sympathy with that <i>aggressive</i> feature of
the system, before named.</p>

<p>But to come to the details of this work, and how
it should be begun and carried on: First choose
wisely the location for a new church or mission Sabbath-school.
Then select one or more men and
women full of life and zeal as a nucleus of interest
and labor. Next survey and visit systematically all
the families in the district, and present the objects
and the value and adaptedness of the Sunday-school
to their wants. Pray much and at every step,
privately and socially, especially in the early stages
of the effort.</p>

<p>Get all ready for a good commencement. Have
every thing arranged, so that not a moment of delay
in finding the right hymn, or in singing it, will prompt
the children to find something else to do. Do not admit
children faster than you can conveniently control them.
Some superintendents aim at gathering a rush of
scholars the first Sabbath or two, and the result is that
they lose months in getting to order and control of
the children. It is often better to admit only a dozen
or two new scholars at a time, and get them well
classified and arranged, and in the hands of good
teachers. There most be order, and the superintendent
must wait for it, although he may not at the first
do much beside. Much depends upon starting right.
Have Testaments, hymn-books, and Sunday-school
papers, if possible, ready on the first Sabbath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Select a clear, distinct, easy lesson at the first, and
whatever is done, let it be well done. Select the
teachers carefully, and admit none who have not a
good report, and are not of a teachable spirit. Meet
with the teachers socially every week, if possible, to
aid them with your suggestions and help. Be cheerful,
earnest, and respectful to all. Keep up a regular
visitation of teachers and scholars, and let your
visits bear a fraternal and not an inquisitorial aspect.
Prove yourselves the true friends of parents and
scholars, and never get out of patience or discouraged
because you cannot gain the children of Roman
Catholics or Jewish parents at once: it may be only
a question of time. At any rate, do them all the good
you can at their homes, whether you ever lead them
to the Sunday-school or not. Duty is ours&mdash;results
belong to God. Through the children reach the
parents, and through the parents reach the children.
Let your errand to the house always be one of kindness
and good-will, so that if they do not receive you
kindly it will be because they misunderstand you.
These visits, however, are almost invariably well received
if made in a natural, pleasant manner, proceeding
from a "charity which hopeth all things." Respect
and honor the parents all you can, whether they commit
their children to your care or not. Exhibit our
beautiful library books, our sweet songs, our attractive
children's papers, and speak of the great kindness
and love of the teachers to the children.</p>

<p>It is very desirable to have a course of regular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
week-day evening lectures for the children and parents.
One week it may be "Jerusalem," another
"coal," another "coral," and the next "the ocean,"
and then some subject of natural history, as the "elephant;"
and illustrate highly to meet the eyes. Take
especial care of the older boys and girls, and strive
to introduce week-day exercises that will interest
and please them. Appoint them upon committees
and to little offices, and give them all something to
do&mdash;something that they can do, something that they
will do cheerfully.</p>

<p>The following, from <i>The Sunday-School Times</i>,
is a beautiful illustrative example of mission Sunday-school
work and teaching. It is entitled "Bill Jones;
or, Our Colored Sabbath-school:"</p>

<div class="small">

 <p>It was one of those perfect Sabbaths in the early June, that I walked
 with trembling heart along the locust-shadowed sidewalk leading to
 our little chapel. On that day our colored Sunday-school was to be
 organized; and we, who only a few weeks since had professed before
 men and angels to love our Saviour, were to be enlisted as workers in
 our Master's vineyard.</p>

 <p>What can be done to improve the religious condition of our colored
 population? was a question which had long occasioned anxious thought
 among the godly of our village. Originally slaves, they had, when the
 law of liberation was proclaimed through New York, refused to remove
 farther than the grassy common, where, almost within the shadow of
 "Massa's house," they were allowed to build their humble cabins.
 Increased afterward in numbers, the suburbs of the town had become
 edged with their miserable tenements. One or two attempts had been
 made to establish preaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
 among them by a minister of their own race, but thus far without
 success. True, in the "brick church," a part of the gallery was set
 apart especially for their use. Still the "dark corner" (as the
 mischievous boys called it) was only occupied by a few old uncles and
 aunties, while the rest, though within sound of the sweetest of all
 Sabbath bells, were as utterly without God in the world as their
 brethren in Africa.</p>

 <p>At length a Sabbath-school was determined on. As most of those able
 and willing to work were already engaged, one of the officers of the
 church volunteered to superintend the school, provided he might have
 the assistance of a band of young girls, who hitherto had been
 privileged to assemble week after week as a Bible-class in the
 "pastor's study."</p>

 <p>On the first Sabbath about thirty or forty children were assembled of
 all ages and sizes, with wondering eyes; and in a few moments I found
 myself seated in a chair before six boys, whom I at once recognized
 as some of the worst village urchins, always to be seen at the
 "depôt," or on the "hotel steps," laden with baskets of apples and
 pea-nuts, their own best customers. I was about to ask for more
 hopeful subjects, but our earnest superintendent only held out to me
 the class-book and pencil&mdash;and I was alone with my destiny.</p>

 <p>Among the names, I registered Andrew Jackson, Andrew Jackson, Jr.,
 Marquis Lafayette, George Washington, and Byron Clarke. When about to
 inquire the cognomen of the last, I was forestalled by his calling
 out, in a stentorian voice, "My name a'n't nothing but <i>Bill
 Jones</i>; but I guess you have heard of the boy who sings nigger
 songs and dances Jim Crow at the 'Harrison House.'" He was
 unfortunately not mistaken in his notoriety, and the task before me
 assumed a new magnitude. None of them could read, and after half an
 hour of A B C, I proceeded to ask some simple questions of Bible
 history, of which I soon found that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
 knew absolutely nothing: their ideas of God, even, were as wild as
 those of the little Hindoos. So I began at the beginning. I spoke of
 the six days of creation; then of the deluge. When in my account of
 the ark and its wondrous freight, I was interrupted by one. "Did they
 have bears?" "Yes," I answered. "And lions?" "Yes." "Elephants?"
 "Yes." "Monkeys?" "Yes." And finally Billy Jones, all eagerness, "Did
 they have a <i>clown</i>?" And I found to my utter dismay that my
 youthful auditors, certainly not incapable of association of ideas,
 had conceived of Noah merely as the proprietor of a menagerie
 travelling in that wild waste of waters. Truly this was fallow
 ground. But our superintendent only smiled encouragement, and bade me
 go forward.</p>

 <p>Sabbath after Sabbath rolled on, and rain or shine my six boys were
 always in their places. They had learned to love the school,
 especially the sweet hymns; and their quick sympathies had gone out
 to one who at least always tried to treat them gently and kindly. Of
 their affection I had many unmistakable proofs. Once I remember
 walking in one of the quiet streets. I was suddenly startled by three
 sonorous cheers, and looking up I saw the "Marquis," Andrew Jackson,
 and Byron Clarke. Though not precisely the most agreeable greeting
 for a young lady, I could not in my heart do less than wave a return.
 Again, they frequently brought to our door presents of flowers and
 fruit. In one instance the latter bore such a striking resemblance to
 some rosy-cheeked apples in a neighbor's orchard that I was forced to
 reprove the boy, and the next Sabbath took for our "lesson talk" the
 eighth commandment. Not many days after the same child made his
 appearance at the kitchen, his hands filled with the first
 pond-lilies of the season; and as he gave them to me he said, "There,
 Miss Esther, you will like them, for <i>they's honest; God growed
 them in the outlet</i>." Never, from that day to this, have flowers
 brought more true gladness to my heart than did those pure white
 blossoms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
 plucked by swarthy hands in the "outlet" where "God growed them."</p>

 <p>We established a missionary society among them, and many a penny,
 previously devoted to fire-crackers and the like, now found its way
 down the red chimney of our "savings bank." Poor Bill Jones had less
 to give than any of the boys, and this I plainly saw troubled him a
 great deal. He had stopped dancing "Jim Crow," first on Sabbath, and
 of late on week-days; and this being his chief source of revenue, his
 spare pennies were few and far between. One day, with a bright face,
 he asked me "if it was not right to do good on Sundays?" Of course I
 replied yes; and then "if it was wrong to take money for doing good
 on Sundays?" This was a nice distinction&mdash;one which I felt him not
 capable of understanding should I attempt it. So I simply said, "No,
 I thought not." Though feeling rather curious, I had no opportunity
 just then of asking as to these pious earnings. Next Sabbath the
 teachers were requested to remain a moment. A gentleman arose, not a
 member of our school, saying that a few hours since he had witnessed
 a scene which had so touched his heart that he could not forbear
 cheering us with the glad tidings. Passing the "Harrison House," he
 noticed that the invariable group of Sunday-noon loungers had
 deserted their post. Just then his ear was caught by a clear
 melodious voice singing. It seemed to come from the bar-room. Yes, as
 he drew near, from the open windows of that den of pollution floated
 out on the summer air the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-center">
<div class="poetry">

   <div class="line quote">"Watchman, tell as of the night,</div>
   <div class="line">What its signs of promise are."</div>

</div>
</div>

 <p>He stepped upon the low platform and looked in. On a table sat a
 negro boy. About the room were hard-faced young men, and those older,
 on whose bloated features intemperance had set its livid brand. But
 they were all listening. The singer finished the last verse, and then
 began again. This time he sang, "Jesus, lover of my soul."</p>

 <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
 My own eyes were dimmed, said the gentleman, as he came to the lines,</p>

<div class="poetry-center">
<div class="poetry">

   <div class="line quote">"Vile and full of sin I am;</div>
   <div class="line">Thou art full of truth and grace."</div>

</div>
</div>

 <p>It seemed as if for a moment an angel's wing brushed away the shadow
 from those darkened hearts, and tears moistened cheeks long unused to
 heart-rain. The singing stopped. "Go on, go on, we will pay you
 more," said one and another. "I cannot now," answered the boy; "it is
 time for Sunday-school, but I will sing again next Sunday, if you'll
 come." And as he put into his pocket the coppers that were handed
 him, he said, "I wouldn't take these, only I am going to send them to
 the heathen. I'll sing you the hymn&mdash;it's beautiful&mdash;about
 'Greenland's icy mountains;'" and humming it to himself, "Bill Jones"
 left the bar-room.</p>

 <p>Reader, should it ever be your good fortune to walk down this
 thickly-shaded village street on a Sabbath morn, you might within
 those very halls, now pure and white, hear the rich baritone voice of
 "Bill Jones" leading in some song of Zion, and with him many others,
 "plucked as brands from the burning."</p>

<h2>XXIII.<br />
THE CONVERSION AND CULTURE OF CHILDREN.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capI-007.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IMMEDIATE conversion ought to be the
aim and expectation of every faithful Sabbath-school
teacher. It is indeed a poor
excuse to suffer a child to drown because we have
but <i>one</i> opportunity of saving it. When a child is
in danger of perishing, we do not first try to educate
it, but to <i>save</i> it. The fact evidently is, that the great
mass of children ought to be led directly to Christ
and become child-Christians without delay; and
multitudes would so become, methinks, if parents
and teachers and pastors had sufficient confidence in
the power of God's Word and Spirit, and had faith
for the early conversion of children to God.</p>

<p>Nearly one and a third centuries ago that great
divine, Jonathan Edwards, of Northampton, wrote
the account of the conversion, as he thought, of little
<i>Phebe Bartlett</i>, at the early age of four years,
together with her Christian life for one year thereafter,
and the evidences of a gracious change of her
heart. The little book has been published since in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
many of the languages of Europe. Little Phebe
Bartlett lived for sixty years after this, and neither
herself nor her friends ever doubted that she truly
met with a saving change of heart at the early age
named by President Edwards. Many of our most
learned divines and most devoted and useful Christian
ladies date their conversion to the early age of
three, four, five, and six years.</p>

<p>We have heard many pastors declare in Sabbath-School
Conventions&mdash;two on one occasion&mdash;"That
they never could remember when they did not love
the Lord Jesus with all their heart;" and we believe
with the pious Richard Baxter that if Christian
parents were faithful in the use of the means God
has put in their hands, the most of their children
would be converted before they are old enough
to understand a sermon.</p>

<p>It is a fact that should never be forgotten, that the
children, even the little children of our Christian families
and Sunday-schools, all <i>want</i> to be Christians
more than they want anything else. Little ones of five
or six years tell us that they wet their pillows night
after night with tears of sorrow for sin, and they
long for some one to lead them to Jesus, more than
all earthly longings. Such is the testimony of devoted
ministers and Christian ladies in great numbers,
and many of us can realize it all, most bitterly,
if we will only recall our early childhood and live
that over again.</p>

<p>Said one little girl of four summers: "Mamma,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
I should think that anybody that knows Jesus would
<i>love him</i>."</p>

<p>This is the feeling of properly-trained children in
great numbers. They want pure, simple instruction
who Jesus Christ is, and what he is to <i>them</i>.</p>

<p>All the gospel knowledge really necessary for
salvation lies, as it were, in a nutshell. The knowledge
of their fall and sinfulness, and the atonement
and redemption there is in Christ Jesus, and which,
to a willing mind, can be taught in a few minutes,
is all the knowledge really necessary for salvation.
Really teach this and it will remain attached to the
natural conscience for life, and only awaits the spark
of grace from the Holy Spirit to descend and act
upon it, and renew the heart and change the life.</p>

<p>This subject is one of overwhelming importance.
It is the vital point of all Bible teaching. When
Sabbath-school teachers learn the holy art of leading
children to Jesus, then we may expect constant conversions.
Sometimes we have known one-third of
all the members of large Sabbath-schools to unite with
the Church of Christ in a single season. Why should
this not oftener be the case? Why should it not be
the general rule in all our schools? and will it not be
if the teachers will but have faith in God, faith in
his Word, and faith in childhood, and <i>aim directly</i>
to bring the children to Christ for salvation "at this
time and under my instruction?" The great point is
to get Bible truth, the Word of God, which is the
sword of the Spirit, to bear directly on the conscience,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
heart and life of the child. Convince him
thereby of his sin; then lead him by a simple trusting
faith to Jesus' blood shed for <i>him</i>. Seek the
proffered, willing aid of God's Holy Spirit believingly,
and the work is done. "This is life eternal, to know
thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou
hast sent."</p>

<h3><i>Child-Culture.</i></h3>

<p>Immediately connected with conversion is Christian
child-culture and training in Bible knowledge,
religious habits and service, and Christian character.
Oh how important it is for child or man to have a
kind, judicious sympathizing Christian friend at hand
at every step, especially in the first year of life after
conversion, to inquire and counsel as to difficulties
and dangers! Secret and social prayer, the regular
study of the Word, the social life and habits, the
reading, the associations, the feelings, the imagination,
the judgment, and the desire and tendencies all
want watching, counselling, checking, guarding or
instructing by one who is tender, candid, sincere and
true. The whole life and usefulness much depends
upon all this. The churches of Christ ought all to
be such training-fields of Christian culture, but alas!
we are sorry to confess that they are not generally so,
and consequently largely fail in this their great work.
To throw a little child, with only a spark of grace in
the heart, into this world of wolves of temptation
and error, with no one to watch over, counsel and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
guide, oh, it is sad indeed, and ought to excite the
sympathy and prayers of all godly people. Let us
associate and band Sunday-school workers together
in earnest, in this great work of Christian culture and
holy living&mdash;in little prayer-meetings teaching the
children how to pray, how to resist temptation and
fight against sin, and stand up for Jesus, how to
overcome bad tempers and feelings, how to cultivate
the disinterested missionary spirit of the gospel in
caring for others, and doing good to others as we
have opportunity. The children, like young trees
from the nursery, need early "to be <i>planted</i> in courts
of the Lord," if we would have them to grow up
comely trees of righteousness.</p>

<h3><i>Children's Prayer-Meetings.</i></h3>

<p>Children, even little children, need to be taught
<i>how</i> to pray. We all need to be taught to pray "as
John also taught his disciples." This is especially
true with children, because the prayers of the minister,
or of the father around the family circle, are in
most cases examples which a child will not try to
follow. The words and expressions are, for the most
part, quite unintelligible to a child, and consequently
they must be taught in a different way. We must
call the attention of a child to the particular things
which he wants, or ought to thank God for, the
particular sins which would be in his child's confession,
and just the things he wants to ask God for in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
his own language every day and hour mingled with
adoration and praise.</p>

<p>Children's prayer-meetings are well adapted to
this. Some of our Sabbath-schools hold such a
meeting at the close of each afternoon session. A
gentleman who is just adapted to the work leads off
the little boys who choose to attend, and a motherly
lady goes with the girls into another room. We
have known eighty to follow her into the room, and
as many as half the number voluntarily follow her in
prayers of two or three or four simple petitions for
just what the little girls feel that they want. The
meeting opens with singing a familiar hymn, and
then a few appropriate verses and remarks, just
adapted to kindle devotion in the little hearts, and
then the little prayers follow freely and almost spontaneously.
They soon learn to love to pray, and
pray in real faith too, for the whole life of a little
child is a life of faith. Of course it will all depend
upon the manner in which these meetings are conducted,
just as it is with any other meeting or religious
service. In good hands they prove to be eminently
successful and delightful. They teach the children
how to pray, lead them into the habit of praying
with the heart and voice, and with each other, and
the influence on them, on their families, and the
Sabbath-school is in every way most blessed.</p>

<p>Let the exercises of such meetings be short, natural
and simple, with freedom and not constraint. A
half or three-fourths of an hour is long enough, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
they should not be prolonged. They ought to be
universally adopted.</p>

<h3><i>The Scholar.</i></h3>

<p>It is a great privilege to become a faithful, punctual
scholar in a well-ordered Sunday-school. Unnumbered
blessings follow in the train. He should
be enabled to appreciate this. It is a matter of
primary importance that on his first introduction to
the Sunday-school, he should be given distinctly to
understand its true character, position, appropriate
order and duties, and consent to a willing conformity
to all.</p>

<p>Every scholar should be punctual, orderly, quiet,
and respectful; he should learn and recite his lessons
perfectly; never leave his seat without permission;
address no one but his teacher, as a general rule; be
obliging and pleasant to his class-mates, and set a
good example of reverence for the holy Sabbath.
In testimony of his appreciation of the benefits, and
in some return for them, he will be diligent in bringing
in new scholars, and also be particular to invite
his parents and friends to the Monthly Concerts of
Prayer for Sabbath-schools. The library book should
be carefully read, so that a good account can be given
of its contents to the teacher, if requested, and the
special instruction of the teacher may, also, profitably
become a subject for conversation with the parents.
Above all, it is the duty and privilege of the scholar
in the Sunday-school to learn the way, and find without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
delay, salvation by Christ in his own rich and
joyous experience, and then to fill his heart and
mind with a general and particular knowledge of
Bible truths, and learn how to practice all in his
daily life.</p>

<p>Nothing short of this experience should be the aim
of every pupil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

PREACHING TO CHILDREN.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capG-208.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GREATER attention to the children in the
public exercises of the Church is becoming
a real necessity. With one-half of all the
members of the families of the church and congregation
before the pastor, as well as the population,
under twenty years of age, and those in the
most hopeful forming period of life, the question
should forcibly arise, Are they not entitled to a far
greater proportion of their pastor's labors and efforts
than they have hitherto received? The General
Assembly of the Presbyterian Church, at Dayton,
Ohio, requested all their pastors to "give at least
one-half of every Sabbath service to the children
and youth." And Bishop Janes in a Methodist
Episcopal Conference recently expressed the opinion
that "the time is coming when there will be two
sermons preached to children and youth where
there is one to adults;" and Rev. Dr. McIlvaine, of
Princeton, took very strong ground in favor of
preaching to children in the New Jersey State Sabbath-School
Convention at Elizabeth, two or three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
years ago. But we are met with this great difficulty
at the outset: Many ministers say, "We cannot
learn how to preach to children," to which we reply,
confidently, "If you would only take one-quarter
the pains to learn <i>how</i> to preach to children that
you have to learn how to preach to adults, you
would generally succeed to so great an extent as to
astonish yourself and all your friends. Therefore,
1. The plan is practicable. 2. The subject is of
overwhelming importance and imperative necessity.
3. Take a practical interest in the children. 4. Set
about gathering and arranging materials for it. Have
blank books to record every thought, fact, or illustration,
and scrap books in which file in all good
illustrations of Scripture truths from newspapers,
magazines, etc.&nbsp;5. Commence regularly and systematically
to preach to children; for the way to learn how
to preach to children is&mdash;<i>to preach to children</i>."</p>

<p>All this will involve the necessity of a watchful
study of child-nature, child-language, and child-character.
Something must be prepared especially
adapted to attract and interest the children with fresh
illustrations, etc. The Rev. Dr. Newton's sermons
are admirable models. "The Peep of Day," "Line
upon Line," and "Precept upon Precept," are fine
specimens of pure child-language. Bible truths and
illustrations are unequalled to interest children if
they are only clearly presented, in a life-like, earnest
manner, and broken up into little pieces for their use.
It should ever be remembered that good preaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to children never fails to be most interesting to the
older people. Good preaching to children by the
pastor every week will greatly elevate all our
monthly concert, missionary, and anniversary addresses,
which should often be far more scriptural;
and methinks, if the pastor would but preach one
good scriptural sermon to the youth every Sabbath,
both himself and his people would find a rich
blessing in it.</p>

<h3><i>Address to Children&mdash;In Outline.</i><br />
<small><i>The Child Jesus.</i></small></h3>

<div class="small">

 <p>Luke ii.&nbsp;40. "And the Child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled
 with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon him:" <i>Grew</i> an
 infant, then a boy, afterward a man. Labored, suffered and
 <i>died</i> for you, for me.</p>

 <p>I. See <i>The Child's Strength</i>. Not like Samson or David. Strong
 to do God's will, to do right. Resolute purpose, will, determination,
 etc. Jesus was strong to learn, to teach, to submit, to reprove and
 suffer. Strong to resist the world, flesh, and the devil. Strong for
 self-control.</p>

 <p>II. See <i>The Child's Wealth</i>. Not Gold, Diamonds, etc., but
 <i>Wisdom</i>. How he got it? He gathered it. Where? Bible, doctors
 in temple, from the Spirit, from the world, etc.</p>

 <p>III. See <i>The Child's Beauty</i>. The grace of God. Not beauty of
 face. Perhaps he had lost his beauty, "his face was as marred." It
 was beauty within; meek and quiet spirit; beauty of holiness, of
 obedience, of humility, of love.</p>

 <p>1. God thought him beautiful. "In his Father's likeness," "All of his
 glory," etc.</p>

 <p>2. Angels thought him beautiful. "They wondered and adored:" "Angels
 desired to look."

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
 3. Men thought him beautiful. "The Leper, the Demoniac, the Blind,
 the Palsied," etc.</p>

 <p><i>Do you</i> think him beautiful? or is there "no beauty in him that
 you should desire him?"</p>

 thee."</p>

<h2>XXV.<br />
CHILDREN'S MEETINGS AND MONTHLY CONCERTS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THESE meetings are now becoming not only
very important, but very interesting both to
children and to adults. Sometimes Sabbath
evening is set apart for it every week or every
month; in other cases a week-day evening is chosen,
and familiar and instructive lectures given. In other
instances, again, a public children's meeting follows
the regular teaching hour on Sabbath afternoons. If
well conducted, these meetings are among the most
acceptable and profitable and crowded of all the
religious assemblages in a community.</p>

<p>The great word to study in the plan of such a
meeting is&mdash;<i>adaptation</i>. It should be adapted not
only to the little children, but also to the older ones,
and especially to the young men and women, as well
as parents and friends, who may be present. If it is
held on the Sabbath, the great idea of worshipping
God should never be lost sight of for a single moment.
The reply may be&mdash;"To do this, and at the
same time to adapt all the services to all the various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
ages and classes, is a very difficult matter." Of
course it is difficult, but not impossible. The
speaker to children, when in the presence of adults,
should always choose a train of thought and illustration
which will reach the children not only, but
interest, instruct, and impress the older ones. A
little special preparation and saving of materials
just adapted to such occasions will accomplish it.
The hymns and music should be appropriate and
devotional, and only such as the children are familiar
with and love to sing. The prayers should be short
and simple, in order that all the children can join in
them. A few verses only of Scripture should be
read, but let them be made plain and interesting
to all.</p>

<p>In some schools the Sabbath lesson is reviewed by
the superintendent and illustrated, followed by five-minute
remarks on the lesson by the teachers or
friends present. In other places the children will
bring scriptural texts to prove "what God says
about obeying parents," about the holy Sabbath,
about intemperance, or gambling, or lying, etc., interspersed
with remarks. At other times a verse of
Scripture, with the word "love" or "faith" or "heaven,"
etc., may be given by the scholars, improved,
with instructive comments upon the passages, by
the superintendent or pastor. At one concert we
heard the children recite, by classes, the Scripture
lessons of the last quarter, and the teachers recited
the pastor's texts which he had preached from during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the past three months. This was followed by an
appropriate address, and all produced a most solemn
effect. The history of a Scripture event, or character,
or epoch will always furnish an abundance to
interest. We do not favor elaborate or strained
efforts. "Simple and Scriptural" would be our
motto, and full of life, and the children and all
will enjoy it exceedingly. Sometimes a report of
the school incidentally, or the reading of a Christian
letter or the words of a Christian visitor, may be
timely. Let everything be prepared beforehand, and
have no delay or hesitation.</p>

<h2>XXVI.<br />
AUXILIARY ASSOCIATIONS.</h2>

<h3><i>Youths' Temperance Societies.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE terrible scourge of intemperance is
making sad progress in our land. Whole
families, men, women, and children, are
desolated by it. Beer, domestic wines, cordials, and
even medical prescriptions, are all made to contribute
to, and swell this river of death. The only safe and
sovereign remedy is&mdash;<i>total abstinence</i>. This conservative
principle, in order to be the most effective,
should be fully inculcated in early childhood; for
our young men, after stimulating their appetites,
often lose all power to stop. Therefore the children
in our families and Sunday-schools ought to
be early trained in abhorrence of all that leads to this
dangerous and vicious course. Drinking leads to
falsehood and deception, hypocrisy and dishonesty,
impurity, and sometimes to murder. No love of
parents or children, husband or wife, reputation,
influence, character or wealth is sufficient to restrain.</p>

<p>It is therefore fitting that our youth be early instructed
and guarded against the steps toward this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
great evil. Particularly ought the children in our
Sabbath-schools to be made familiar with what God
has said on this subject in the Bible. These texts
should be often repeated by the scholars and explained
and enforced by their teachers. Many
fathers will say: "Rather let my son be an abject
slave for life than to fall a victim to this degrading,
destructive habit of intemperance." The question
arises, When and how this can best be taught? We
are always careful to protect Sabbath-schools from
any diversion from the regular Scripture lesson of
the day. The Bible and Bible-teaching is the glory
of Sabbath-schools. Therefore we would never
allow temperance or missionary work, or singing, or
addresses to interrupt it. It is preferable in communities,
we think, to take Saturday afternoons for a
month or two for this purpose. Say, meet in the
largest church at three to four and a half o'clock or
three and a half to five o'clock P.M. Organize a
Youths' Temperance Society. Appoint a discreet
youth of fourteen or sixteen years President, with
other officers, with a committee to arrange for each
meeting. Secure good, fresh, appropriate speakers,
and never allow a dull, heavy orator to occupy
the children's attention. Instruction, life-like and
adapted must constantly prevail. Some of the older
boys, twelve to eighteen years old, may prepare and
recite a ten-minute speech or appeal to their associates.
The young ladies may write brief essays,
giving their views upon the subject, which may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
read. Secure as speakers the ministers, lawyers, etc.,
of the place, who can sustain attention, and who are
known to be temperance men. Select and appoint
twelve boys and the same number of girls, who
shall circulate the pledge and obtain signatures.
Continue the meetings only so many weeks as shall
be needed and the interest shall be fully sustained,
and then discontinue them for a few months. It
will be necessary, however, to have some such temperance
revival once in six to twelve months, in
every place, to keep the cause in the ascendant and
save the children, and the meeting and the result will
be delightful to all. We have known a thousand
pledges taken in this way, within a few weeks, in a
country village of twenty-five hundred population.</p>

<p>In some schools the children recite in the monthly
concert, texts which tell us what the word of God
says about intemperance, and brief addresses are
added. Another plan, which succeeds admirably in
many Sabbath-schools, is to organize "Bands of
Hope," on the plan which originated in Scotland in
1847, and in America in 1855. The pledges exclude
not only other intoxicating liquors, but beer, cider,
and also tobacco and profanity. They have a regular
constitution, and forms of conducting them, with
catechisms, hymns, dialogues, etc., all of which may
be obtained at a trifling expense.</p>

<p>Their mode of admitting members is very impressive.
The Temperance Catechism brings out a
mass of facts on "The Origin and History of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Temperance Societies," "Nature of Intoxicating
Drinks," "Fermentation and Distillation Process,"
"Brewing," "Alcohol and Mixtures," "Wines
of Scripture," "Bible Abstinence," "Tobacco,"
"Profanity," etc.</p>

<p>Under the head of wine at the Lord's Supper, it
holds that the Bible does not say what kind of wine
was used, but we think it was unfermented, because
at the time of the feast of the Passover the Jews were
commanded to put away all leaven, and the word
wine does not occur in any of the Evangelists when
giving an account of the Lord's Supper. It was the
fruit of the vine. Pliny, the Roman historian, has
left an account of the various wines used at that
time, in which he states that out of three hundred
kinds of wine then in common use, only one would
burn&mdash;that was called Falernian wine; that proves
that two hundred and ninety-nine kinds of wine did
not contain alcohol, and the chances, so to speak,
are two hundred and ninety-nine to one in favor of
Timothy's wine being unintoxicating. These extracts
will suffice as specimens of what may be found in
these little catechisms and tracts. They contain
much valuable and needed information, whatever
form of temperance effort is made on behalf of the
children.</p>

<p>Juvenile Temperance Meetings are conducted,
like any other good children's meetings, with much
appropriate singing by the children, and prayer
and reading of a few Scripture verses, and short,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
stirring, instructive addresses, so adapted that the
interest must never for a moment flag. Sermons by
the pastors are also amongst the most valuable ways
of promoting sound temperance principles and
practice.</p>

<h3><i>Youths' Missionary Associations.</i></h3>

<p>These are usually formed for a definite object&mdash;generally
to support missionaries; to plant Sabbath-schools
in destitute sections; or to aid in supplying
poor schools with libraries. Every month they
receive letters telling what has been done. They are
organized by the appointment of a President, Secretary,
Treasurer, and sometimes Collectors. A
monthly missionary meeting is held and a yearly
anniversary. At these meetings, besides reading
the Scriptures, prayer, and singing by the children,
reports are given of the doings and results, and letters
are read giving details of the good accomplished.
Addresses, brief and to the point, are then made by
the pastor, superintendent, or one of the teachers, or
by some invited friend of the cause. These missionary
meetings should always be attended, not only
by the pastor, teachers, and scholars, but also by the
parents and members of the church and congregation,
and should be made very interesting.</p>

<p>It has become quite popular now, in many
schools, to organize each class into a distinct missionary
circle, with a name and motto, as: "Earnest
Workers," "The Harriet Newell Circle," "The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Lambs of Jesus," "The Buds of Promise," "Dew
Drops," "Little Travellers," "Willing Hearts,"
"Modest Workers," "Cheerful Givers," "Young
Timothies," "The Sowers," "The Guiding Stars,"
"Youthful Disciples," "Rose of Sharon," "Little
Samuels," "The Reapers," "Olive Plants;" etc.
Each circle or class reports through a committee
every month to the school. Sometimes each class
has a small cheap banner, with its name printed
on it.</p>

<h2>XXVII.<br />
SABBATH-SCHOOL MUSIC.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS is a very important and attractive part
of the exercises of a good Sunday-school, if
rightly conducted. Good, pure, simple
music, such as children love to sing, and words embodying
the best Christian sentiments and feelings,
should always be chosen. There is such an abundance
of music at the present time, of an elevating,
excellent character, that there is no excuse for adopting
that which is doubtful. Some of the holiest
Christian influences are carried weekly into little
hearts and numerous families by these sweet songs
of the children. It is well worth while for every
Sunday-school to obtain a good supply of the best
music, such as the children like; and they often love
to meet on some afternoon or evening for the purpose
of practising their music with their kind-hearted
leader. It is the remark of a wise man: "Let me
make the ballads of a nation, and I care not who
makes its laws." How vastly important, then, it is
to the future well-being of our youth that they be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
well supplied with the choicest words and music to
praise God in these little assemblies!</p>

<p>A few words of caution may be appropriate:
Sing no more than that which will be truly worship
and devotional on the Lord's day. Introduce all
new hymns with great care to make the children
<i>understand</i> the true sentiment before they sing it.
Consequently, not more than one new hymn should
be presented to the school on any one Sabbath. Let
the practice in them take place on a week-day, or
so as not to interrupt the worship of the Sabbath-school.
Never should singing be introduced as an
entertainment or diversion in the Sabbath-school, or
made a hobby. Sacred music has a higher, holier
mission. The hymns should be appropriate to the
circumstances and occasion, and adapted in conformity
to the Bible lesson of the day.</p>

<p>There is a great amount of music and hymns introduced
into our schools of a very improper character.
The hymns are nothing but a jingle of nonsense,
and the music sometimes has very doubtful associations.
All this should be avoided most carefully.
Several of our Sunday-school music-book makers, it
is said, have made a large profit out of the schools on
the sale of a single book. We think this is not right.
We are opposed to paying thirty-five cents for hymns
and music in a book for children, when the music notes
are of no use to the children, and the hymns can be
sold for one-half of the price. Let the superintendent
and music choristers have the books with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
notes, of course. Besides, some of our best Sabbath-school
superintendents are largely using Watts's and
Wesley's and Cowper's hymns from our church hymn-books
in their schools with great success, and they
even sing church-music. If the hymns are adapted
to the lesson, and are carefully explained to the
children, so that they get a clear idea of their meaning,
they sing them with great spirit and gladness of
heart&mdash;such hymns as "When all thy mercies, O my
God;" "On the cross uplifted high;" "Jesus, and shall
it ever be;" "Hail my ever-blessed Jesus;" "My
Saviour, my almighty Friend;" "There is a fountain
filled with blood;" "Jesus, I my cross have taken,"
etc., etc. These, and many more like them, are used
in preference to Sunday-school hymns, and the children
greatly enjoy them. By the aid of stencil plates
these hymns as needed, one for each Sabbath, are
placed in large plain letters on sheets of white muslin,
and suspended so as to be easily read by the whole
school. Thus, every head is kept erect, and there is
no diversion in looking over the hymn-book, and as
a result the order is better, and the singing is better
in every way.</p>

<h2>XXVIII.<br />
MEANS AND MEASURES.</h2>

<h3><i>Anniversaries.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capA-174.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ANNIVERSARIES have been quite common
of late years; they seem to be very appropriate,
and when well conducted, are
productive of good. The summing up of the labors
of the year in the annual report is often of more
than local interest. The presence, orderly deportment,
and singing of the children are all calculated
to leave a happy, salutary impression. They are
conducted with alternate hymns, prayers, addresses
with the report, and are usually on the afternoon or
evening of the Sabbath, with crowded audiences.</p>

<p>Here are brought out for prayer and review all the
plans and work of the school for a twelve-month.
The addresses should always be appropriate, instructive,
and interesting to all, tending always to an
increased spirituality and higher religious tone to the
school. They should always reach the parents and
friends present, as well as the children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Excursions and Exhibitions.</i></h3>

<p>Pic-nics, exhibitions, and the like, are all rather
dangerous things in connection with Sunday-schools.
In very sound, discreet, judicious Christian hands,
they are often productive of good to all concerned;
while under young, giddy, thoughtless management,
they sometimes result in evil. Great caution should,
therefore, be used. It will require much more grace
and wisdom to conduct a Sunday-school exhibition
than it will an ordinary service of the school. Says
one writer: "Show-children are sometimes gotten
up and exhibited, as if they were insensible to flattery
as prize poultry." "A word to the wise is
sufficient."</p>

<h3><i>Premiums and Rewards.</i></h3>

<p>We would carefully avoid entailing upon any Sunday-school
a <i>system</i> of premiums and rewards, for
several reasons. 1. It is needlessly expensive; 2. It
is almost impossible to find a corps of teachers who
are so good accountants as to be enabled to administer
the system impartially; and thus jealousies and
dissatisfactions arise both on the part of teacher and
pupils; 3. Some of the very <i>kindest</i> teachers are
often induced to reward those not <i>strictly</i> entitled to
them, and as a consequence, loose and dishonest
habits of business are taught the scholars; 4. After
the novelty is worn off, the children learn to depend
upon and claim their reward as a matter of right
which they are justly entitled to, having earned it&mdash;thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
an improper habit and motive of action is
entailed.</p>

<p>The pupils are debtors to the teachers, not the
teachers to the pupils. We would not discourage
the occasional judicious awarding of premiums to
deserving scholars by the school, the teacher, or by
benevolent individuals only let them be given for a
specific extra service&mdash;such as gathering new
scholars, extraordinary punctuality, recitations, or
sober attention for a long period of time; and let
them be awarded so seldom as to be valued and
influential.</p>

<h3><i>Benevolent Contributions.</i></h3>

<p>Benevolent contributions in our Sunday-schools
are assuming an attitude of much importance, and
it is, therefore, a point that needs to be well guarded
from danger. It is very important that our children
be early taught the principles and practice of benevolence;
of caring for the ignorant and destitute, and
doing them good according to their several abilities.
They should especially be taught to <i>earn</i> and <i>save</i>
money, instead of asking parents for it. Let it all
be real and sincere. Great care should also be taken
with the children to give for definite objects, and
thus secure for them careful reports of what is done
with their money. We should, however, most
strictly conform to these legitimate objects, and on
no account permit them to interfere in any way with
the great work of teaching the Bible; and guard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
them especially against being so conducted as to
foster pride, envy, and vain-glory. This can and
should be done. The small penny rivulets of the
millions of Sunday-school children, uniting, have
swelled to a mighty stream, enlivening and refreshing
many a dark, moral waste in our own and other
lands, carrying untold blessings to myriads, and
therefore, we are the more solicitous to keep the
fountain pure and free.</p>

<h3><i>Catechisms.</i></h3>

<p>Most church and many mission schools adopt and
successfully and regularly teach the great system of
religious truths contained in these excellent compendiums
of Christian doctrine. Sometimes one
Sabbath a month, and sometimes a part of one, is
allotted to this service, and not unfrequently the pastor
meets with them, and reviews the lesson. It is preferable,
however, to appoint a special service for the
catechism, so as to let nothing interfere with the
Scripture lesson of the day. "To the law and to
the testimony."</p>

<p>There is a great want, however, of a sound, good
catechism, translated into the best language of children
of the present day, so that they can the more
readily receive the truth into their understandings.</p>

<h3><i>Two Sessions.</i></h3>

<p>Most of the schools in the city of New York and
vicinity, and some other cities, hold two sessions a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
day. The reasons they give for this course are, that
teachers have not time faithfully to make the deep,
permanent impression on the hearts of their pupils
in one session that they think is necessary; that
they cannot do justice to themselves, the children, or
the lesson; that no thorough system of teaching can
be carried out with one session; that the schools
with one session, as a general rule, have only a
struggling, lingering existence, and that neither
pupils nor teachers will consent to return from
two, to one session a day. With two sessions, they
say, they have time to go over, <i>finish</i>, and <i>apply</i>
the lesson, hear the enforcement or illustrations of
the superintendent, and several times sing their
sweet songs of Zion. Besides, they find their rest
in the hearty service. Change from the Sabbath-school
to a sermon is a relief, and change is rest. So
that faithful, earnest teachers very rarely complain
of too much labor or fatigue. Every church and
school, however, determines this question for itself.</p>

<h3><i>Constitution and By-Laws.</i></h3>

<p>Sunday-schools usually adopt a few plain rules to
govern them; we therefore give a simple form:</p>

<div class="small">

 <p><span class="smcap">Art. 1.</span> This Sabbath-school is connected with the &mdash;&mdash;
 Church, or shall be called the &mdash;&mdash; Sabbath-school.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Art. 2.</span> It shall consist of a Superintendent, a Secretary, a
 Librarian, and as many teachers and scholars as may be duly received
 and appointed. The usual duties will be assigned to the different
 officers of the school.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Art. 3.</span> This school shall open at &mdash;&mdash; o'clock in the morning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
 and &mdash;&mdash; o'clock in the afternoon, and each session shall continue
 one hour and &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Art. 4.</span> On the first &mdash;&mdash; of January, or July &mdash;&mdash;, the
 terms for which all the officers are elected each year shall expire,
 and the teachers shall proceed by ballot, at such time, to elect new
 officers, or to re-elect the old ones.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Art. 5.</span> Strict order shall be observed, and all the rules
 conformed to, by every one connected with the school, and no one
 shall leave the room until the close of the school, without
 permission.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Art. 6.</span> The annual meeting, or anniversary, shall be held in
 the month of &mdash;&mdash;, at which time reports for the year shall be made,
 and an address by the pastor, or some other person who may be
 invited. Quarterly meetings for business, and weekly meetings for
 mutual assistance and counsel, and for the study of the lesson, shall
 be held by the teachers and officers.</p>

 <p><span class="smcap">Art. 7.</span> This Constitution may be amended at any annual
 meeting, and By-Laws may be made or amended at any quarterly meeting,
 by a majority of all the teachers.</p>

 <p>The By-Laws should define when and where teachers' meetings,
 missionary meetings, temperance or boys' meetings, or social
 Christian gatherings, may be held; and also what penalty, if any, for
 absence from teachers' meetings, etc.; also any other necessary
 objects may be included in the specifications of the By-Laws.</p>

<h2>XXIX.<br />
SABBATH-SCHOOL GUARDIANS.</h2>

<h3><i>Parents.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capP-094.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PARENTS are the divinely appointed guardians
of their children. There is no shrinking
from their responsibility except by unfaithfulness,
and no evading it without guilt. In a
few short, fleeting hours parents hold a position of
honor and responsibility unparalleled in the duties
of any human being.</p>

<p>In the case of Christian parents we believe that
God has given them the power to paralyze the influence
of the best Sabbath-school teacher or pastor
in the land. If they give the cold shoulder to the
Sabbath-school, they ought to understand that they
will generally destroy its entire influence for good
upon their children. Therefore they ought actively
and heartily to co-operate with the Sabbath-school
teacher and pastor in this work with the young.
Parents who are not Christians cannot present so
mighty a barrier; but every parent holds an important
relation to the teachers and the school.</p>

<p>Parents should watch over the school, often visit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
it, and manifest a deep interest in it. They should
also notice and kindly check any tendency to error
in doctrine or practice. They may counsel and suggest
in every appropriate way whatever will advance
its best interests, and they should personally know
and kindly recognize the teacher as the friend of their
children, and welcome and aid him in his visits to
their homes. They should also contribute liberally
and cheerfully to the support of the school, and particularly
to the library. They should see that their
children punctually attend school, commit their lessons
to memory, and thus co-operate with the voluntary
unpaid teacher, in giving their children the best
and most valuable of all knowledge, and by God's
blessing leading them to Christ for salvation.</p>

<p>Parents, accept the teachers to supplement and aid
your efforts to save your offspring, but never, in any
case, allow anything to supersede or lessen your obligations
or spiritual labors for your own children.</p>

<h3><i>Pastors.</i></h3>

<p>We are fully convinced that our Sabbath-schools
will never rise to what they ought to be until our
pastors become the well-instructed leaders in this
great work. We laymen are not in all cases sufficiently
reliable nor fitted to be the leaders. We
should take the place assigned to us by the Rev. Dr.
Kirk, of Boston, in the State Sunday-School Convention
of Massachusetts, when he said he "loved
to recognize Sabbath-school teachers as lieutenants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in the great army in which Christ Jesus has made him
one of the captains."</p>

<p>Our Sabbath-schools, churches and ministers must
all rise together. They should always keep closely together.
It is here that Christians find a good working
field under the training of the pastor, who is the pastor
of the Sunday-school as well as of the church. It
is here that the Church finds a great field of labor
and her largest additions. Some pastors simply
give their Sunday-schools their patronage and approbation.
This is not sufficient. Much more is
needed. Active co-operative service and direction
are wanted. Sometimes pastors must needs act as
superintendent of their own Sabbath-schools, and
conduct their own teachers' meeting for a time, until
they can train brethren and fit them to be superintendents.
It is not lecturing, or preaching to, on the
subject that we so much need as how to superintend,
how to prepare the lesson, how to visit, what to
teach, how to teach and lead to Christ, and how to
conduct teachers' meetings.</p>

<p>The Sabbath-school enfolds the lambs of the flock.
The pastor should, of course, watch over it very carefully
and very tenderly. Every Sabbath he should
at least walk through the school to encourage, by his
presence, the weary teachers and scholars in their
work of faith and labor of love. Many of the best
pastors in our land make this an invariable rule. The
teachers need their pastor's counsels and assistance
in the school, the teachers' meetings and concerts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
prayer, as well as in the pulpit. Here he will find
his true working men and women, and if any of the
church have especial claims upon him, they surely
do have.</p>

<p>We need our pastors' presence and counsel in all
our conventions and gatherings of teachers. They
are <i>ex-officio</i> members of all. We also need their
help in calling out the membership of the churches;
in model sermons and model scriptural addresses,
and teachings to children for instruction and for example.
In fact, we feel that we must rely upon our
ministers to raise up and make our Sunday-schools
what they ought to be&mdash;the great training-schools
of the Church, and the fitting field of labor for her
large membership. As a matter of necessity, and as
a matter of propriety, we throw ourselves as Sabbath-school
workers upon the pastors, and call earnestly
upon them for personal aid and comfort, in the strong
assurance that our appeal will receive a warm and
favorable response.</p>

<h3><i>The Church.</i></h3>

<p>The Church of Christ is the grand centre and
radiating point of all our Christian efforts. The
Sabbath-school is simply the Church of Christ
<i>itself</i> putting forth its legitimate <i>action</i>. Says Dr.
Baldwin: "It is the <i>workshop</i> of the Church for all
working Christians." Here she trains her members
for personal service and leads the lambs into the
true fold. The nearer in sympathy our Sunday-schools
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
are kept to the churches the better it will be for
all; and if superintendents and teachers wish to give
their labors a permanently successful character, they
cannot make too short work in leading their pupils
to the Church of Christ; at first, perhaps, as only
attending, hearing members, then believing, obeying
members. The outer, or mission-schools, are stepping-stones
to churches. If mission-churches are
established with those schools, as is often the case,
the Church will be on convenient ground. Sunday-schools,
Bible, and tract mission efforts should be
superintended and sustained by the churches. Especially
should the churches stand by the Sunday-schools&mdash;the
nurseries of the Church&mdash;and see that
they want no good thing. Rooms, seats, books, and
all appliances, should be freely provided for the
school; for the future hopes of Zion are there. By
far the greater number of her additions from the
world come through the Sabbath-school.</p>

<p>Not one-half of the children of our land, or
scarcely of any State in our land, can be found on
the Lord's day in any of our Sabbath-schools.</p>

<p>The churches ought, without delay, to supply this
lack. Surely we can ask no less of them. The
churches are abundantly able to do this. They have
never trained and sent forth as Sabbath-school
teachers as many as fifteen per cent. of their great
membership, and not half the children are yet
taught. Let the churches train and send forth thirty
per cent. of their members, and the neglected are all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
reached and the work is done. Therefore the question
is one of disposition, will&mdash;not ability.</p>

<h3><i>The Community.</i></h3>

<p>The community has a deep personal interest in
the Sunday-school, and has corresponding duties.
Thousands of youth are every year saved from prison
and from crime by this institution. The three hundred
and fifty or four hundred thousand voluntary Sunday-school
teachers of our land comprise a moral police,
to which the community are immensely indebted,
whether they are sensible of it or not. It recently
cost New York city more than twenty-five thousand
dollars to convict one murderer, who had been neglected
from a child. That sum of money would
have paid his board for sixty years, or sustained
twenty thousand children in mission-schools for a
whole year. The Sabbath-school is a cheap and
simple agency to give the gospel to the millions.
It is the cheapest civilizer extant.</p>

<p>Thousands of the best patriots, statesmen, and Christians
of our own and other lands love to acknowledge
their immense obligations to the Sabbath-school, for
what they are, and what they hope to be. Said the
Bishop of London: "The Sunday-school has <i>saved</i>
the manufacturing districts." And the Earl of Shaftesbury
declared: "To you, Sunday-school teachers, is
entrusted the future of the British empire."</p>

<p>Many thousands of parents in our land, who are
entirely neglecting the religious instruction of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
children, can bring them to the Sabbath-schools,
where four hundred thousand voluntary teachers
stand cheerfully ready to teach them, without money
and without price. Like the waters of the river of
life, this stream runs free. Let parents see to it that
their children are regularly there. The community
should do all they can to help forward this beneficent
voluntary scheme of public education, acknowledge
their real obligation to the teachers, offer them rooms
in their public school buildings, and by the pressure
of a sound public sentiment, increase the uniform
attendance, particularly from the ignorant and
neglected classes.</p>

MISSIONARY AGENCIES.</h2>

<h3><i>Neighborhood Prayer Meetings.</i></h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capT-010.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Sabbath-school teacher in his work finds
it convenient to do incidentally a vast amount
of good. He distributes copies of the Bible
and Testament, tracts and good reading, helps the
needy to a place for work, relief, etc., etc. Among
other means the opening of neighborhood prayer-meetings
has been greatly blessed. A score or two
of friends and neighbors meet on a week-day evening
in a tenant-room or house convenient, and
there two or three of the Sabbath-school teachers
conduct a familiar religious service, which, if appropriate
and interesting, often results in conversions
and bringing individuals into Christian associations
and influences, and sometimes leads to the reformation
of a whole neighborhood. Our young women
teachers sometimes conduct these meetings with
great success and profit.</p>

<p>A good mission-school of teachers has sometimes
sustained a dozen weekly neighborhood prayer-meetings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
All these plans are equally adapted to
cities or country villages.</p>

<h3><i>Bible Readers.</i></h3>

<p>Of late years the employment of pious and discreet
women as Bible readers has accomplished the most
blessed results. These constant visitors penetrate
many a dark alley and cellar, and rescue from intemperance,
starvation, destitution and crime those who
would not otherwise be reached. They also comfort,
and instruct, and aid multitudes of poor ignorant
mothers who really know not what to do, and sustain
many neighborhood prayer-meetings and mothers'
meetings. Sometimes they are supported by the
Bible Society, and in other cases by the City Mission,
but oftener by the mission or church Sabbath-schools
and churches.</p>

<p>Young women who are adapted to the work leave
their sewing and other labor, and receive a salary
sufficient for their support in this service. Some of
the poor ignorant, reclaimed women make, when
trained for it, most excellent Bible readers.</p>

<h3><i>Industrial Schools.</i></h3>

<p>Industrial schools are usually for girls from the
streets, who are picked up, washed, supplied with a
dinner, taught to read, to sew, and other useful employments;
besides, good manners and good dispositions
are carefully cultivated. They are also taught
to sing our choicest Sabbath-school hymns, and receive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
much valuable counsel and sound Christian
instruction from their kind teachers and friends.
These schools are doing a most excellent work.
They are held every day in institutions. In Sunday-schools
they are generally held only on Saturday
afternoons, and a score of ladies volunteer to come
and teach them. In either form they are very useful.</p>

<h3><i>Boys' Meetings.</i></h3>

<p>This is a modern thing, but it grew out of the
warm, earnest sympathy of excellent Christians for
the worst class of street-boys of New York. They
were attracted by the fine music taught them, the interest
and kindness manifested toward them, and
the stirring, pointed, interesting stories in which religious
truth was clothed as it was spoken to them;
and the energy and capability which first started
those meetings could sustain them now on the
same basis. Latterly, they assume more the general
form of young people's meetings, being composed
of a majority of boys and girls from Christian families,
or at least Sunday-schools, and most of them
contain but a few of the rough street-boys. They are
a stepping-stone to a good Sunday-school. Youths'
attractive papers are circulated at the close. Interesting
popular lectures, made very familiar and plain,
on practical subjects, are sometimes enjoyed on the
week-day evenings.</p>

<h2>XXXI.<br />
THE QUESTION BOX.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capA-174.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AMONG the modern improvements in our
Sabbath-school meetings the "Question
Box," or "Drawer," is worthy of particular
mention. Slips of paper are placed in the hands
of the members of the Convention or Institute, who
are requested to write upon them any question which
may be suggested to their minds, and on which they
would like to gain the opinions of others. These
questions are, from time to time, dropped into a box
provided, and left at the door or on the platform.
Otherwise, they are collected by a committee and
handed up to the conductor, who, at the proper time,
either answers them himself or designates some
other person or persons to answer them. In this
way a vast amount of clear and correct information
is often gained, and that of a kind exactly adapted
to present wants. No exercise in an Institute is
more directly profitable than the question box often
proves to be.</p>

<p>It of course depends entirely upon the correct
knowledge and grasp of the persons who essay to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
answer; for either truth or error are alike rapidly
propagated in this way. Therefore the greatest
care should be taken that no one be allowed to
answer questions in this way, who cannot, as the
result of mature and deliberate observation or experience,
comprehensively look on all sides of the
question, and be careful to do justice to all its points.
No "snap" judgment should be taken, no witticism
indulged in, and no dogmatic answers allowed. On
the contrary, the utmost fairness and candor is indispensable.</p>

<p>For illustration of this subject, the following
examples of questions and answers will suffice:</p>

<p>1. How can we obtain good teachers? <i>Answer.</i>
Train them up in your Bible-classes and teachers'
meetings. Be on the lookout for suitable persons
and excite their interest by conversations on the
value, the details, and working of the Sabbath-school.</p>

<p>2. Would you recommend the grading of Sabbath-schools?
<i>Answer.</i> We like the word <i>adaptation</i>
better, for there must be <i>that</i> in all good teaching;
there must be, also, advancement and thorough
Bible instruction. But we fear that an attempt to
grade Sunday-schools would stiffen and injure them,
for we have but one hour in a week, while the public
schools have six hours per day and five days in a
week, with a dozen grades of text-books, and paid,
disciplined teachers. Besides, we have never found
a successful Sabbath-school with more than the three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
regular gradations; viz., the infant-classes, the intermediate
classes, and the young men and women's
classes.</p>

<p>3. Would you ever employ unconverted teachers?
<i>Answer.</i> Get the <i>best</i> teachers you can; the most
pious, the best skilled and regular. When you have
taken the <i>best</i> you can get, you have done all your
duty, and God does not require any more, for he
accepts according to what we have. In some remote
sections it is simply a question between accepting
moral and upright young people or no teachers.
They can teach the elemental truths of religion, and
God has repeatedly employed the most unworthy
persons to deliver his most solemn messages. Therefore
get the <i>best</i> teachers you can. It is the message,
not the messenger.</p>

<p>4. Do you approve of one uniform lesson for the
whole school? <i>Answer.</i> Yes, by all means; and
then concentrate all the exercises, the prayers, the
hymns, the addresses, as well as all the teaching,
directly upon that one portion, so that it will be
impressed upon all, as it was upon a little boy who
walked up to the blackboard and pointed to the
drawing of an altar and the bleeding lamb upon it,
saying, "It was <i>that</i> all day, wasn't it, Jimmy?"
Let the infant-class have the central verse for their
lesson.</p>

<p>5. Would you expel a bad boy? <i>Answer.</i> I
never did, and never would do so, except as a last
resort, after trying every available resource.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
6. How can we get the parents, pastors, etc.,
interested in the Sabbath-school? <i>Answer.</i> Go to
them and respectfully ask their counsel and advice
about the Sabbath-school. Get them to investigate
and inquire, give them hints and information, and
thus excite their interest.</p>

<p>7. Is it consistent for a Sabbath-school teacher to
play at cards, dance, etc.? <i>Answer.</i> Cards are gamblers'
tools, and we should beware of them. Besides,
the teacher's time is too precious. I have never danced
since I first became a Sabbath teacher, nearly forty
years ago. It will lessen Christian influence. "If
meat make my brother to offend," says Paul, "I
will eat no flesh while the world standeth."</p>

<p>8. What is the best way to get rid of inefficient
teachers? <i>Answer.</i> Treat them with the most tender
consideration. Call upon them and give them some
hints about a verse in the lesson, which they can use
with this or that scholar in their class. I have
always found it better to make poor teachers over,
than to look up and train new ones.</p>

<p>9. How can you restore order in a disorderly class?
<i>Answer.</i> The teacher mast first be in the most perfect
order and control himself, and he will soon control
the class, if his patience holds out.</p>

<p>10. What is the pastor's position in the Sabbath-school?
<i>Answer.</i> He is the pastor of the lambs in
the Sabbath-school as well as of the church.</p>

<p>11. Is it best to reprove scholars or teachers in
presence of the class or classes? <i>Answer.</i> <span class="smcap">Never</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
12. Who are to elect the superintendent? <i>Answer.</i>
In most cases he should be elected by the teachers,
not by the scholars.</p>

<p>13. Who appoints the teachers? <i>Answer.</i> They
are generally appointed by the superintendent.</p>

<p>14. How long ought a lesson to be? <i>Answer.</i>
Six to ten verses, and forty minutes' time for the
teacher.</p>

<p>15. What is the best way of training teachers?
<i>Answer.</i> Get for them <i>The Sunday-School Times</i>,
and attract them into the regular weekly teachers'
meeting.</p>

<p>16. How shall we retain young men and women?
<i>Answer.</i> Get a teacher who loves, honors, and respects
them and can understand young people, and
does not forget that he was once young. Then elevate
the Sabbath-school, so that the young people will
not be belittled in attending it.</p>

<p>17. Is there not danger that the Sabbath-school
will induce a disrelish for the preaching service?
<i>Answer.</i> We must certainly guard against such a
result. The Sabbath-school must cling close to the
Church of God.</p>

<p>18. How much money should be expended annually
on a large mission-school? <i>Answer.</i> A fair
Christian economy is <i>best</i>. I know of mission-schools,
of four hundred scholars, sustained at an expense
of less than four hundred dollars, including rent,
that are better every way, they are more regular and
successful, than some similar schools which expend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
from one thousand to twelve hundred dollars per
year.</p>

<p>19. How many children are there in all our Sabbath-schools?
<i>Answer.</i> If the question refers to the
United States, I think we may safely say that now
we have, in Sabbath-schools, about four million
children and youth, with about four hundred thousand
teachers. A quarter of a century ago or so,
the numbers were estimated at two million five
hundred thousand, but this was when the great Western
States were in their comparative infancy. The
number rapidly increased to three millions, and then
to three million five hundred thousand, and now our
returns and estimates reach four millions. Great
Britain has about the same number, both of teachers
and scholars; but we do not think all other countries
can raise the full number of Sabbath-school children
quite up to <i>ten millions</i>, or the number of Sabbath-school
teachers to a grand army of <i>one million</i>
strong. The census of 1860 gave the number of
persons in the United States, between the ages of
five and sixteen, at nine millions (or only a few
thousands less). As a consequence, we have the
great aggregate of <i>five millions</i>! of unreached and
uncared-for children and youth in our land. What
an immense and hopeful missionary field here lies
open at our doors! There is scarcely a State in our
whole Union or a city which can truly report <i>one-half</i>
of her children in any kind of a Sabbath-school
on any given day. And yet some of our great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
States are working very energetically and systematically.
Witness the State of Illinois, which has
organized every one of its one hundred and two
counties during the past two or three years, by the
voluntary and Sunday-school missionary labors of
its Sunday-School Association, aided by other
agencies. What this State has done, other States, if
they will, can do, and the immense work before us,
when systematically undertaken, is by no means a
hopeless task.</p>

<h3><i>The Answer Box.</i></h3>

<p>Nearly allied to the question box is the answer
box. It consists in this: At an appropriate time in
an Institute, the conductor writes an important question
on the blackboard&mdash;blank papers are distributed
and all the members are requested to write their
answers. For instance, all are requested to write
upon the question, What is the great want of our
Sabbath-schools? One writes, "The Holy Spirit,
praying teachers, aim at conversions," etc. Another
writes, "Good superintendents, devoted pastors and
parents." Another writes, "Clear teaching, good
order, and devout singing." Others, "The Bible
needs to be exalted and applied;" "Make the Bible
attractive to the children;" "Living, earnest teachers
who love the children;" "Aim at salvation and
Christian training." Or if the question should be,
"How to prepare a Bible lesson?" one answers
"1. Pray. 2. Read it over carefully. 3. Think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and pray. 4. Look up the parallel passages. 5. Examine
Commentaries, Dictionaries, etc.&nbsp;6. Search
out illustrations for each pupil.&nbsp;7. How to apply
truth to each and all." Another writes: "1. Fix on
the subject early in the week, keep it constantly before
the mind, trying to find illustrations anywhere
and everywhere. 2. Endeavor to make it simple,
yet interesting and practical.&nbsp;3. Constantly seek
divine direction."</p>

<p>At the close of a recess of ten minutes for writing
and receiving the answers, they are taken up and
read by the conductor, and then referred to a committee
of three to digest and report upon at a future
meeting. We get at the heart of the people in this
way.</p>

MISTAKES OF TEACHERS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/capI-007.jpg" width="50" height="50" alt=""/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is a mistake to suppose that mere <i>talk</i> is
teaching.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to think that hearing a Bible
lesson recited, or the reading of questions from a
book, or telling stories, is good Sabbath-school teaching.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to think that one who in manner
and temper is impatient, dogmatic, overbearing,
slow, heavy or dull, can be a good Sabbath-school
teacher.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that one who is not
understood, or is misunderstood, is a good teacher.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose he who gossips with
his class is a good teacher.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose, because we have a
general idea beforehand, that we shall be able to
supply the details and illustrations as we go along.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to underrate oral teaching,
and overrate merely reading and reciting from the
Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
It is a great mistake to think that our scholars are
too young to appreciate a well-prepared lesson or a
well-governed school.</p>

<p>It is a mistake of teachers to expect attention from
motives of duty, or the sacredness of the day or importance
of subject&mdash;nothing but real interest will
secure it.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to teach as if all young children
had the same <i>tastes</i>.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to fail to arouse curiosity and
awaken interest.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that we shall be understood
without careful simplicity of language.</p>

<p>It is a mistake not to recall by questions the last
Sabbath's lesson, and to treat lessons as if they were
isolated; by all means connect them.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake for teachers to think that giving
good advice or exhortation to children is as good
as "breaking down" Bible truths with questions and
answers.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that many common
terms, such as "Providence," "grace," repentance,
justification, etc., convey any meaning to children,
ordinarily.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to attempt to purchase affection or
attention by frequent gifts to children; neither by
threats nor punishments.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake of Sabbath-school teachers to
suppose that their work is that of a mere philanthropist&mdash;or
a moral educator, or a mere promoter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
social good order, or raising up of good citizens and
children.</p>

<p>It is a mistake of teachers to expect a cold reception
from parents.</p>

<p>It is a mistake of teachers to suppose that their
manner and habits are unobserved by the children.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to avoid repetition with children&mdash;simplify
and repeat.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to teach our children, that if they
will be good and read the Bible, pray and join the
Church, they will thereby go to heaven. Nothing
but repentance toward God and faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ will secure that.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake for Sabbath-school teachers
ever to teach Bible truth without being really in <i>earnest</i>&mdash;calmly,
cheerfully, seriously in <i>earnest</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVERY thorough workman ought to have the best of tools to work with,
and the teacher should be furnished with all needful helps. The
<i>indispensable</i> books for a Sabbath-school teacher are&mdash;1st. A
complete reference Bible&mdash;your own Bible. 2d. A Concordance. 3d. A
good Bible Dictionary. Add to these, accurate and careful observation
to see in the opening flower, the falling leaf, the events of the day
and the providence of God, rich and apt lessons for youthful hearts.
On opening my library door I notice upon the shelves most of the

<h3><i>The Teacher's Covenant.</i></h3>

<p>Impressed with the serious nature of the charge,
will the faithful Sabbath-school teacher enter into a
written engagement with his Saviour, in words somewhat
like the following?&mdash;</p>

<div class="small">

 <p>1. <i>I promise</i> to be in my place punctually every Sabbath, at
 the time appointed, unless prevented by sickness, or some other cause
 so urgent that it would in like manner keep me from important worldly
 business.</p>

 <p>2. <i>I promise</i>, in every such case of unnecessary absence, that
 I will use my utmost diligence to secure a suitable substitute, whom
 I will instruct in the character of the class and the nature of the
 duties to be performed.</p>

 <p>3. <i>I promise</i> to study carefully beforehand the lesson to be
 recited by the scholars, and to have the subject in my mind during
 the week, so that I shall be likely to lay hold of, and lay up for
 use, anything that I may meet with in my reading or experience that
 will illustrate or enforce the lesson of the approaching Sabbath.</p>

 <p>4. <i>I promise</i> to be diligent in informing myself about the
 books in the library, so that I can guide my scholars in selecting
 such books as will interest and profit them; also in becoming
 acquainted with other good books and tracts, so that I can always be
 prepared, as opportunities may occur, to lead their minds into right
 channels of thought.</p>

 <p>5. <i>I promise</i>, whenever a scholar is absent from the class on
 the Sabbath, that I will visit that scholar before the next Sabbath,
 unless prevented by sickness, or by some other hindrance so grave
 that it would, under like circumstances, keep me from attending to
 important worldly interests.</p>

 <p>6. <i>I promise</i> to visit statedly <i>all</i> my scholars, that I
 may become acquainted with their families, their occupations, and
 modes of living and thinking, their temptations, their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
 difficulties, and the various means of reaching their hearts and
 consciences.</p>

 <p>7. <i>I promise</i>, if any of my scholars or their parents do not
 attend statedly any place of worship, that I will make the case known
 to the superintendent and pastor, and that I will use continued
 efforts to induce such children and their parents to go to church
 regularly.</p>

 <p>8. <i>I promise</i> that every day, in my hour of secret prayer, I
 will pray distinctly, by name, for each one of my scholars, for their
 conversion, if they are still out of Christ; for their sanctification
 and growth in grace, if they are already converted.</p>

 <p>9. <i>I promise</i> that I will seek an early opportunity of praying
 with each scholar privately, either at his house or mine, or in some
 other convenient place that may be found, and of asking him in a
 serious and affectionate manner to become a Christian.</p>

 <p>10. <i>I promise</i>, when I have thus prayed and conversed with each
 scholar once, that I will begin and go through the class again, not
 omitting any, and not discontinuing my attempts, but going on
 faithfully, week by week, month by month, and year by year.</p>
